<p><i>The Stage represents a room in the Deacon&rsquo;s

1780.&nbsp; <i>C.</i>, <i>a door</i>; <i>L. C.</i>, <i>a second
and smaller door</i>; <i>R. C.</i>, <i>practicable window</i>;
<i>L.</i>, <i>alcove</i>, <i>supposed to contain bed</i>; <i>at
the back</i>, <i>a clothes-press and a corner cupboard containing
bottles</i>, <i>etc.</i>&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Mary

<h5>SCENE I</h5>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>To these</i> <span
class="smcap">Leslie</span>, <i>C.</i></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; May I come in,
Mary?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Why not?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; I scarce knew where
to find you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; The dad and I must have
a corner, must we not?&nbsp; So when my brother&rsquo;s friends
are in the parlour he allows us to sit in his room.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis a great favour, I can tell you; the place is
sacred.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; Are you sure that
&lsquo;sacred&rsquo; is strong enough?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; You are satirical!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; I?&nbsp; And with
regard to the Deacon?&nbsp; Believe me, I am not so
ill-advised.&nbsp; You have trained me well, and I feel by him as
solemnly as a true-born Brodie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; And now you are
impertinent!&nbsp; Do you mean to go any further?&nbsp; We are a
fighting race, we Brodies.&nbsp; Oh, you may laugh, sir!&nbsp;
But &rsquo;tis no child&rsquo;s play to jest us on our Deacon,
or, for that matter, on our Deacon&rsquo;s chamber either.&nbsp;
It was his father&rsquo;s before him: he works in it by day and
sleeps in it by night; and scarce anything it contains but is the
labour of his hands.&nbsp; Do you see this table, Walter?&nbsp;
He made it while he was yet a &rsquo;prentice.&nbsp; I remember
how I used to sit and watch him at his work.&nbsp; It would be
grand, I thought, to be able to do as he did, and handle
edge-tools without cutting my fingers, and getting my ears pulled
for a meddlesome minx!&nbsp; He used to give me his mallet to
keep and his nails to hold; and didn&rsquo;t I fly when he called
for them! and wasn&rsquo;t I proud to be ordered about with
them!&nbsp; And then, you know, there is the tall cabinet yonder;
that it was that proved him the first of Edinburgh joiners, and
worthy to be their Deacon and their head.&nbsp; And the
father&rsquo;s chair, and the sister&rsquo;s workbox, and the
dear dead mother&rsquo;s footstool&mdash;what are they all but
proofs of the Deacon&rsquo;s skill, and tokens of the
Deacon&rsquo;s care for those about him?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; I am all
penitence.&nbsp; Forgive me this last time, and I promise you I
never will again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Candidly, now, do you
think you deserve forgiveness?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; Candidly, I do
not.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Then I suppose you must
have it.&nbsp; What have you done with Willie and my uncle?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; I left them talking
deeply.&nbsp; The dear old Procurator has not much thought just
now for anything but those mysterious burglaries&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; I know!&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; Still, all of him
that is not magistrate and official is politician and citizen;
and he has been striving his hardest to undermine the
Deacon&rsquo;s principles, and win the Deacon&rsquo;s vote and
interest.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; They are worth having,
are they not?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; The Procurator seems
to think that having them makes the difference between winning
and losing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Did he say so?&nbsp;
You may rely upon it that he knows.&nbsp; There are not many in
Edinburgh who can match with our Will.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; There shall be as
many as you please, and not one more.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; How I should like to
have heard you!&nbsp; What did uncle say?&nbsp; Did he speak of
the Town Council again?&nbsp; Did he tell Will what a wonderful
Bailie he would make?&nbsp; O why did you come away?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; I could not pretend
to listen any longer.&nbsp; The election is months off yet; and
if it were not&mdash;if it were tramping upstairs this
moment&mdash;drums, flags, cockades, guineas, candidates, and
all!&mdash;how should I care for it?&nbsp; What are Whig and Tory
to me?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; O fie on you!&nbsp; It
is for every man to concern himself in the common weal.&nbsp; Mr.
Leslie&mdash;Leslie of the Craig!&mdash;should know that much at
least.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; And be a politician
like the Deacon?&nbsp; All in good time, but not now.&nbsp; I
hearkened while I could, and when I could no more I slipped out
and followed my heart.&nbsp; I hoped I should be welcome.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; I suppose you mean to
be unkind.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; Tit for tat.&nbsp;
Did you not ask me why I came away?&nbsp; And is it usual for a
young lady to say &lsquo;Mr.&rsquo; to the man she means to
marry?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; That is for the young
lady to decide, sir.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; And against that
judgment there shall be no appeal?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; O, if you mean to
argue!&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; I do not mean to
argue.&nbsp; I am content to love and be loved.&nbsp; I think I
am the happiest man in the world.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; That is as it should
be; for I am the happiest girl.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; Why not say the
happiest wife?&nbsp; I have your word, and you have mine.&nbsp;
Is not that enough?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Have you so soon
forgotten?&nbsp; Did I not tell you how it must be as my brother
wills?&nbsp; I can do only as he bids me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; Then you have not
spoken as you promised?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; I have been too happy
to speak.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; I am his
friend.&nbsp; Precious as you are, he will trust you to me.&nbsp;
He has but to know how I love you, Mary, and how your life is all
in your love of me, to give us his blessing with a full
heart.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; I am sure of him.&nbsp;
It is that which makes my happiness complete.&nbsp; Even to our
marriage I should find it hard to say &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; when he
said &lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; Your father is trying
to speak.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll wager he echoes you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>to</i> <span
class="smcap">Old Brodie</span>).&nbsp; My poor dearie!&nbsp; Do
you want to say anything to me?&nbsp; No?&nbsp; Is it to Mr.
Leslie, then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; I am listening, Mr.
Brodie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; What is it, daddie?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Old Brodie</span>.&nbsp; My son&mdash;the
Deacon&mdash;Deacon Brodie&mdash;the first at school.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; I know it, Mr.
Brodie.&nbsp; Was I not the last in the same class?&nbsp;
(<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>.)&nbsp; But he seems
to have forgotten us.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; O yes! his mind is
wellnigh gone.&nbsp; He will sit for hours as you see him, and
never speak nor stir but at the touch of Will&rsquo;s hand or the
sound of Will&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; It is so good to sit
beside you.&nbsp; By and by it will be always like this.&nbsp;
You will not let me speak to the Deacon?&nbsp; You are fast set
upon speaking yourself?&nbsp; I could be so eloquent,
Mary&mdash;I would touch him.&nbsp; I cannot tell you how I fear
to trust my happiness to any one else&mdash;even to you!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; He must hear of my good
fortune from none but me.&nbsp; And besides, you do not
understand.&nbsp; We are not like families, we Brodies.&nbsp; We
are so clannish, we hold so close together.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; You Brodies, and your
Deacon!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Old Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Deacon of his
craft, sir&mdash;Deacon of the Wrights&mdash;my son!&nbsp; If his
mother&mdash;his mother&mdash;had but lived to see!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; You hear how he runs
on.&nbsp; A word about my brother and he catches it.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis as if he were awake in his poor blind way to all the
Deacon&rsquo;s care for him and all the Deacon&rsquo;s kindness
to me.&nbsp; I believe he only lives in the thought of the
Deacon.&nbsp; There, it is not so long since I was one with
him.&nbsp; But indeed I think we are all Deacon-mad, we
Brodies.&nbsp; Are we not, daddie dear?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span> (<i>without</i>, <i>and
entering</i>).&nbsp; You are a mighty magistrate, Procurator, but
you seem to have met your match.</p>
<h5>SCENE II</h5>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>To these</i>, <span
class="smcap">Brodie</span> and <span
class="smcap">Lawson</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>curtseying</i>).&nbsp; So,
uncle! you have honoured us at last.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; <i>Quam primum</i>,
my dear, <i>quam primum</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Well, father, do you
know me?&nbsp; (<i>He sits beside his father and takes his
hand</i>.)</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Old Brodie</span>.&nbsp;
William&mdash;ay&mdash;Deacon.&nbsp; Greater
man&mdash;than&mdash;his father.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; You see, Procurator,
the news is as fresh to him as it was five years ago.&nbsp; He
was struck down before he got the Deaconship, and lives his lost
life in mine.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Ay, I mind.&nbsp; He
was aye ettling after a bit handle to his name.&nbsp; He was kind
of hurt when first they made me Procurator.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; And what have you been
talking of?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Just o&rsquo; thae
robberies, Mary.&nbsp; Baith as a burgher and a Crown offeecial,
I tak&rsquo; the maist absorbing interest in thae robberies.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; Egad, Procurator, and
so do I.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span> (<i>with a quick look at</i>
<span class="smcap">Leslie</span>).&nbsp; A dilettante interest,
doubtless!&nbsp; See what it is to be idle.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; Faith, Brodie, I
hardly know how to style it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; At any rate,
&rsquo;tis not the interest of a victim, or we should certainly
have known of it before; nor a practical tool-mongering interest,
like my own; nor an interest professional and official, like the
Procurator&rsquo;s.&nbsp; You can answer for that, I suppose?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; I think I can; if for
no more.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an interest of my own, you see, and is
best described as indescribable, and of no manner of moment to
anybody.&nbsp; [It will take no hurt if we put off its discussion
till a month of Sundays.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; You are more
fortunate than you deserve.&nbsp; What do you say,
Procurator?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Ay is he!&nbsp; There
is no a house in Edinburgh safe.&nbsp; The law is clean helpless,
clean helpless!&nbsp; A week syne it was auld Andra
Simpson&rsquo;s in the Lawnmarket.&nbsp; Then, naething would set
the catamarans but to forgather privily wi&rsquo; the
Provost&rsquo;s ain butler, and tak&rsquo; unto themselves the
Provost&rsquo;s ain plate.&nbsp; And the day, information was
laid before me offeecially that the limmers had made infraction,
<i>vi et clam</i>, into Leddy Mar&rsquo;get Dalziel&rsquo;s, and
left her leddyship wi&rsquo; no sae muckle&rsquo;s a spune to sup
her parritch wi&rsquo;.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s unbelievable, it&rsquo;s
awful, it&rsquo;s anti-christian!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; If you only knew them,
uncle, what an example you would make!&nbsp; But tell me, is it
not strange that men should dare such things, in the midst of a
city, and nothing, nothing be known of them&mdash;nothing at
all?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; Little, indeed!&nbsp;
But we do know that there are several in the gang, and that one
at least is an unrivalled workman.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;re right,
sir; ye&rsquo;re vera right, Mr. Leslie.&nbsp; It had been
deponed to me offeecially that no a tradesman&mdash;no the Deacon
here himsel&rsquo;&mdash;could have made a cleaner job wi&rsquo;
Andra Simpson&rsquo;s shutters.&nbsp; And as for the lock
o&rsquo; the bank&mdash;but that&rsquo;s an auld sang.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; I think you believe
too much, Procurator.&nbsp; Rumour&rsquo;s an ignorant jade, I
tell you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had occasion to see some little of
their handiwork&mdash;broken cabinets, broken shutters, broken
doors&mdash;and I find them bunglers.&nbsp; Why, I could do it
better myself!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; Gad, Brodie, you and
I might go into partnership.&nbsp; I back myself to watch
outside, and I suppose you could do the work of skill within?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; An opposition
company?&nbsp; Leslie, your mind is full of good things.&nbsp;
Suppose we begin to-night, and give the Procurator&rsquo;s house
the honours of our innocence?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; You could do anything,
you two!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Onyway, Deacon,
ye&rsquo;d put your ill-gotten gains to a right use; they might
come by the wind but they wouldna gang wi&rsquo; the water; and
that&rsquo;s aye <i>a solatium</i>, as we say.&nbsp; If I am to
be robbit, I would like to be robbit wi&rsquo; decent folk; and
no think o&rsquo; my bonnie clean siller dirling among jads and
dicers.&nbsp; [Faith, William, the mair I think on&rsquo;t, the
mair I&rsquo;m o&rsquo; Mr. Leslie&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; Come the
night, or come the morn, and I&rsquo;se gie ye my free
permission, and lend ye a hand in at the window forbye!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Come, come,
Procurator, lead not our poor clay into temptation.&nbsp; (<span
class="smcap">Leslie</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>talk apart</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m no muckle
afraid for your puir clay, as ye ca&rsquo;t.]&nbsp; But hark
i&rsquo; your ear: ye&rsquo;re likely, joking apart, to be gey
and sune in partnership wi&rsquo; Mr. Leslie.&nbsp; He and Mary
are gey and pack, a body can see that.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Daffin&rsquo;
and want o&rsquo; wit&rsquo;&mdash;you know the rest.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; <i>Vidi</i>,
<i>scivi</i>, <i>et audivi</i>, as we say in a Sasine,
William.]&nbsp; Man, because my wig&rsquo;s pouthered do ye think
I havena a green heart?&nbsp; I was aince a lad mysel&rsquo;, and
I ken fine by the glint o&rsquo; the e&rsquo;e when a lad&rsquo;s
fain and a lassie&rsquo;s willing.&nbsp; And, man, it&rsquo;s the
town&rsquo;s talk; <i>communis error fit jus</i>, ye ken.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Old Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Oh!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; See, ye&rsquo;re
hurting your faither&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Dear dad, it is not
good to have an ill-tempered son.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; What the deevil ails
ye at the match?&nbsp; &rsquo;Od, man, he has a nice bit divot
o&rsquo; Fife corn-land, I can tell ye, and some Bordeaux wine in
his cellar!&nbsp; But I needna speak o&rsquo; the Bordeaux;
ye&rsquo;ll ken the smack o&rsquo;t as weel&rsquo;s I do
mysel&rsquo;; onyway it&rsquo;s grand wine.&nbsp; <i>Tantum et
tale</i>.&nbsp; I tell ye the <i>pro&rsquo;s</i>, find you the
<i>con.&rsquo;s</i>, if ye&rsquo;re able.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; [I am sorry,
Procurator, but I must be short with you.]&nbsp; You are talking
in the air, as lawyers will.&nbsp; I prefer to drop the subject
[and it will displease me if you return to it in my hearing].</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; At four o&rsquo;clock
to-morrow?&nbsp; At my house? (<i>to</i> <span
class="smcap">Mary</span>).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; As soon as church is
done.&nbsp; (<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Ye needna be sae high
and mighty, onyway.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; I ask your pardon,
Procurator.&nbsp; But we Brodies&mdash;you know our
failings!&nbsp; [A bad temper and a humour of privacy.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Weel, I maun be about
my business.&nbsp; But I could tak&rsquo; a doch-an-dorach,
William; <i>superflua non nocent</i>, as we say; an extra dram
hurts naebody, Mr. Leslie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span> (<i>with bottle and
glasses</i>).&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s your old friend,
Procurator.&nbsp; Help yourself, Leslie.&nbsp; Oh no, thank you,
not any for me.&nbsp; You strong people have the advantage of me
there.&nbsp; With my attacks, you know, I must always live a bit
of a hermit&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Od, man,
that&rsquo;s fine; that&rsquo;s health o&rsquo; mind and
body.&nbsp; Mr. Leslie, here&rsquo;s to you, sir.&nbsp;

<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span> (<i>bowing them

Smith, Esquire.&nbsp; And so this is the garding, is it?&nbsp;
And this is the style of horticulture?&nbsp; Ha, it is!&nbsp;
(<i>At the mirror</i>.)&nbsp; In that case George&rsquo;s mother
bids him bind his hair.&nbsp; (<i>Kisses his hand</i>.)&nbsp; My
dearest Duchess,&mdash;(<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Jean</span>.)&nbsp; I say, Jean, there&rsquo;s a
good deal of difference between this sort of thing and the way we
does it in Libberton&rsquo;s Wynd.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span>.&nbsp; I daursay.&nbsp; And
what wad ye expeck?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; Ah, Jean, if
you&rsquo;d cast affection&rsquo;s glance on this poor but honest
soger!&nbsp; George Lord S. is not the nobleman to cut the object
of his flame before the giddy throng; nor to keep her boxed up in
an old mouse-trap, while he himself is revelling in purple
splendours like these.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t know you, Jean: he
was afraid to.&nbsp; Do you call that a man?&nbsp; Try a man that
is.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span>.&nbsp; Geordie Smith, ye ken

frae you.&nbsp; And what kind o&rsquo; a man are you to even
yoursel&rsquo; to the likes o&rsquo; him?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a

just!&nbsp; And don&rsquo;t he live up to it?&nbsp; I say, Jean,

<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span>.&nbsp; What a expense!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span>.&nbsp; Dinna mak&rsquo; a mock

<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; The Deacon&rsquo;s old
man!&nbsp; Well, he couldn&rsquo;t expect to have his quiver full
of sich, could he, Jean?&nbsp; (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Old

world would have been more varigated.&nbsp; Mrs. Deakin
(<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Jean</span>), let me introduce you

<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span>.&nbsp; Think shame to

<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span> (<i>pulling himself

for!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing
out against me this time?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take odds
there is.&nbsp; But it ain&rsquo;t in my hands.&nbsp; (<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Old Brodie</span>.)&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll excuse
me, old genelman?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; Ah, well, if

<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; What the devil brings

<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; <i>Con</i>found it,

<p>[<span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; And not you only:
Jean too!&nbsp; Are you mad?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; There was my uncle
the Procurator&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; The Fiscal?&nbsp; He
don&rsquo;t count.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; What d&rsquo;ye
mean?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; Well, Deakin, since
Fiscal Lawson&rsquo;s Nunkey Lawson, and it&rsquo;s all in the
family way, I don&rsquo;t mind telling you that Nunkey
Lawson&rsquo;s a customer of George&rsquo;s.&nbsp; We give Nunkey
Lawson a good deal of brandy&mdash;G. S. and Co.&rsquo;s
celebrated Nantz.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; What! does he buy
that smuggled trash of yours?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; Well, we don&rsquo;t
call it smuggled in the trade, Deakin.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a wink,
and King George&rsquo;s picter between G. S. and the Nunks.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Gad! that&rsquo;s
worth knowing.&nbsp; O Procurator, Procurator, is there no such
thing as virtue?&nbsp; [<i>Allons</i>!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s enough to
cure a man of vice for this world and the other.]&nbsp; But hark
you hither, Smith; this is all damned well in its way, but it
don&rsquo;t explain what brings you here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve trapped a
pigeon for you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you pluck
him yourself?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; Not me.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s too flash in the feather for a simple nobleman like
George Lord Smith.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the great Capting Starlight,
fresh in from York.&nbsp; [He&rsquo;s exercised his noble art all
the way from here to London.&nbsp; &lsquo;Stand and deliver, stap
my vitals!&rsquo;]&nbsp; And the north road is no bad lay,
Deakin.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Flush?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span> (<i>mimicking</i>).&nbsp;
&lsquo;The graziers, split me!&nbsp; A mail, stap my vitals! and
seven demned farmers, by the Lard&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; By Gad!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; Good for trade,
ain&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; And we thought, Deakin, the Badger and me,
that coins being ever on the vanish, and you not over sweet on
them there lovely little locks at Leslie&rsquo;s, and them there
bigger and uglier marine stores at the Excise Office . . .</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span> (<i>impassible</i>).&nbsp;
Go on.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; Worse luck! . . . We
thought, me and the Badger, you know, that maybe you&rsquo;d like
to exercise your helbow with our free and galliant horseman.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; The old move, I
presume? the double set of dice?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the rig,
Deakin.&nbsp; What you drop on the square you pick up again on
the cross.&nbsp; [Just as you did with G. S. and Co.&rsquo;s own
agent and correspondent, the Admiral from Nantz.]&nbsp; You
always was a neat hand with the bones, Deakin.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; The usual terms, I
suppose?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; The old discount,
Deakin.&nbsp; Ten in the pound for you, and the rest for your
jolly companions every one.&nbsp; [<i>That&rsquo;s</i> the way
<i>we</i> does it!]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Who has the dice?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; Our mutual friend, the
Candleworm.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; You mean
Ainslie?&mdash;We trust that creature too much, Geordie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s all right,
Marquis.&nbsp; He wouldn&rsquo;t lay a finger on his own
mother.&nbsp; Why, he&rsquo;s no more guile in him than a set of
sheep&rsquo;s trotters.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; You think so?&nbsp;
Then see he don&rsquo;t cheat you over the dice, and give you
light for loaded.&nbsp; See to that, George, see to that; and you
may count the Captain as bare as his last grazier.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; The Black Flag for
ever!&nbsp; George&rsquo;ll trot him round to Mother
Clarke&rsquo;s in two twos.]&nbsp; How long&rsquo;ll you be?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; The time to lock up
and go to bed, and I&rsquo;ll be with you.&nbsp; Can you find
your way out?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; Bloom on, my Sweet
William, in peaceful array.&nbsp; Ta-ta.</p>

did not go with them.&nbsp; I have something to tell you.&nbsp;
If you knew how happy I am, you would clap your hands,
Will.&nbsp; But come, sit you down there, and be my good big
brother, and I will kneel here and take your hand.&nbsp; We must
keep close to dad, and then he will feel happiness in the
air.&nbsp; The poor old love, if we could only tell him!&nbsp;
But I sometimes think his heart has gone to heaven already, and
takes a part in all our joys and sorrows; and it is only his poor
body that remains here, helpless and ignorant.&nbsp; Come, Will,
sit you down, and ask me questions&mdash;or guess&mdash;that will
be better, guess.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Not to-night, Mary;

sister?&nbsp; One little minute for your little sister?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Minutes are precious,
Mary.&nbsp; I have to work for all of us, and the clock is always
busy.&nbsp; They are waiting for me even now.&nbsp; Help me with
the dad&rsquo;s chair.&nbsp; And then to bed, and dream happy
things.&nbsp; And to-morrow morning I will hear your
news&mdash;your good news; it must be good, you look so proud and
glad.&nbsp; But to-night it cannot be.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; I hate your
business&mdash;I hate all business.&nbsp; To think of chairs, and
tables, and foot-rules, all dead and wooden&mdash;and cold pieces
of money with the King&rsquo;s ugly head on them; and here is
your sister, your pretty sister, if you please, with something to
tell, which she would not tell you for the world, and would give
the world to have you guess, and you won&rsquo;t?&mdash;Not
you!&nbsp; For business!&nbsp; Fie, Deacon Brodie!&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;m too happy to find fault with you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; &lsquo;And me a
Deacon,&rsquo; as the Procurator would say.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; No such thing,
sir!&nbsp; I am not a bit afraid of you&mdash;nor a bit angry
neither.&nbsp; Give me a kiss, and promise me hours and hours
to-morrow morning.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; All day long
to-morrow, if you like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Business or none?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Business or none,
little sister!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll make time, I promise you; and
there&rsquo;s another kiss for surety.&nbsp; Come along.&nbsp;
(<i>They proceed to push out the chair</i>, <i>L.C.</i>)&nbsp;
The wine and wisdom of this evening have given me one of my
headaches, and I&rsquo;m in haste for bed.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be
good, won&rsquo;t you, and see they make no noise, and let me
sleep my fill to-morrow morning till I wake?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Poor Will!&nbsp; How
selfish I must have seemed!&nbsp; You should have told me sooner,
and I wouldn&rsquo;t have worried you.&nbsp; Come along.</p>

<h5>SCENE I</h5>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>,
<span class="smcap">Hunt</span></p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Lawson</span> (<i>entering</i>).&nbsp;
Step your ways in, Officer.&nbsp; (<i>At wing</i>.)&nbsp; Mr.
Carfrae, give a chair to yon decent wife that cam&rsquo; in
wi&rsquo; me.&nbsp; Nae news?</p>
<p>A <span class="smcap">voice without</span>.&nbsp; Naething,
sir.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span> (<i>sitting</i>).&nbsp;
Weel, Officer, and what can I do for you?]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; Well, sir, as I was
saying, I&rsquo;ve an English warrant for the apprehension of one
Jemmy Rivers, <i>alias</i> Captain Starlight, now at large within
your jurisdiction.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;ll be the
highwayman?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; That same, Mr.
Procurator-Fiscal.&nbsp; The Captain&rsquo;s given me a hard hunt
of it this time.&nbsp; I dropped on his marks first at
Huntingdon, but he was away North, and I had to up and after
him.&nbsp; I heard of him all along the York road, for he&rsquo;s
a light hand on the pad, has Jemmy, and leaves his mark.&nbsp; [I
missed him at York by four-and-twenty hours, and lost him for as
much more.&nbsp; Then I picked him up again at Carlisle, and we
made a race of it for the Border; but he&rsquo;d a better nag,
and was best up in the road; so I had to wait till I ran him to
earth in Edinburgh here and could get a new warrant.]&nbsp; So
here I am, sir.&nbsp; They told me you were an active sort of
gentleman, and I&rsquo;m an active man myself.&nbsp; And Sir John
Fielding, Mr. Procurator-Fiscal, he&rsquo;s an active gentleman,
likewise, though he&rsquo;s blind as a himage, and he desired his
compliments to you, [sir, and said that between us he thought
we&rsquo;d do the trick].</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Ay, he&rsquo;ll be a
fine man, Sir John.&nbsp; Hand me owre your papers, Hunt, and
you&rsquo;ll have your new warrant <i>quam primum</i>.&nbsp; And
see here, Hunt, ye&rsquo;ll aiblins have a while to
yoursel&rsquo;, and an active man, as ye say ye are, should aye
be grinding grist.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re sair forfeuchen wi&rsquo;
our burglaries.&nbsp; <i>Non constat de person&acirc;</i>.&nbsp;
We canna get a grip o&rsquo; the delinquents.&nbsp; Here is the
<i>Hue and Cry</i>.&nbsp; Ye see there is a guid two hundred
pounds for ye.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; Well, Mr.
Procurator-Fiscal [I ain&rsquo;t a rich man, and two
hundred&rsquo;s two hundred.&nbsp; Thereby, sir], I don&rsquo;t
mind telling you I&rsquo;ve had a bit of a worry at it
already.&nbsp; You see, Mr. Procurator-Fiscal, I had to look into
a ken to-night about the Captain, and an old cock always likes to
be sure of his walk; so I got one of your Scotch
officers&mdash;him as was so polite as to show me round to Mr.
Brodie&rsquo;s&mdash;to give me full particulars about the
&rsquo;ouse, and the flash companions that use it.&nbsp; In his
list I drop on the names of two old lambs of my own; and I put it
to you, Mr. Procurator-Fiscal, as a genleman as knows the world,
if what&rsquo;s a black sheep in London is likely or not to be
keeping school in Edinburgh?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; <i>Coelum non
animum</i>.&nbsp; A just observe.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give it a
thought, sir, and see if I can&rsquo;t kill two birds with one
stone.&nbsp; Talking of which, Mr. Procurator-Fiscal, I&rsquo;d
like to have a bit of a confab with that nice young woman as came
to pay her rent.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Hunt, that&rsquo;s a
very decent woman.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; And a very decent woman
may have mighty queer pals, Mr. Procurator-Fiscal.&nbsp; Lord
love you, sir, I don&rsquo;t know what the profession would do
without &rsquo;em!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;re vera
richt, Hunt.&nbsp; An active and a watchful officer.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll send her in till ye.</p>
<h5>SCENE II</h5>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>
(<i>solus</i>)</p>
<p>Two hundred pounds reward.&nbsp; Curious thing.&nbsp; One
burglary after another, and these Scotch blockheads without a man
to show for it.&nbsp; Jock runs east, and Sawney cuts west;
everything&rsquo;s at a deadlock; and they go on calling
themselves thief-catchers!&nbsp; [By jingo, I&rsquo;ll show them
how we do it down South!&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ve worn out a good
deal of saddle leather over Jemmy Rivers; but here&rsquo;s for
new breeches if you like.]&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s have another queer
at the list.&nbsp; (<i>Reads</i>.) &lsquo;Humphrey Moore,
otherwise Badger; aged forty, thick-set, dark, close-cropped; has
been a prize-fighter; no apparent occupation.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Badger&rsquo;s an old friend of mine, &lsquo;George Smith,
otherwise the Dook, otherwise Jingling Geordie; red-haired and
curly, slight, flash; an old thimble-rig; has been a stroller;
suspected of smuggling; an associate of loose women.&rsquo;&nbsp;
G. S., Esquire, is another of my flock.&nbsp; &lsquo;Andrew
Ainslie, otherwise Slink Ainslie; aged thirty-five; thin,
white-faced, lank-haired; no occupation; has been in trouble for
reset of theft and subornation of youth; might be useful as
king&rsquo;s evidence.&rsquo;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s an acquaintance
to make.&nbsp; &lsquo;Jock Hamilton, otherwise Sweepie,&rsquo;
and so on.&nbsp; [&rsquo;Willie M&rsquo;Glashan,&rsquo;
hum&mdash;yes, and so on, and so on.]&nbsp; Ha! here&rsquo;s the
man I want.&nbsp; &lsquo;William Brodie, Deacon of the Wrights,
about thirty; tall, slim, dark; wears his own hair; is often at
Clarke&rsquo;s, but seemingly for purposes of amusement only; [is
nephew to the Procurator-Fiscal; is commercially sound, but has
of late (it is supposed) been short of cash; has lost much at
cock-fighting;] is proud, clever, of good repute, but is fond of
adventures and secrecy, and keeps low company.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now,
here&rsquo;s what I ask myself: here&rsquo;s this list of the
family party that drop into Mother Clarke&rsquo;s; it&rsquo;s
been in the hands of these nincompoops for weeks, and I&rsquo;m
the first to cry Queer Street!&nbsp; Two well-known cracksmen,
Badger and the Dook! why, there&rsquo;s Jack in the Orchard at
once.&nbsp; This here topsawyer work they talk about, of course
that&rsquo;s a chalk above Badger and the Dook.&nbsp; But how
about our Mohock-tradesman?&nbsp; &lsquo;Purposes of
amusement!&rsquo;&nbsp; What next?&nbsp; Deacon of the Wrights?
and wright in their damned lingo means a kind of carpenter, I
fancy?&nbsp; Why, damme, it&rsquo;s the man&rsquo;s trade!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll look you up, Mr. William Brodie, Deacon of the
Wrights.&nbsp; As sure as my name&rsquo;s Jerry Hunt, I
wouldn&rsquo;t take one-ninety-nine in gold for my chance of that
&rsquo;ere two hundred!</p>
<h5>SCENE III</h5>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>; to him <span
class="smcap">Jean</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; Well, my dear, and how
about your gentleman friend now?&nbsp; How about Deacon
Brodie?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span>.&nbsp; I dinna ken your name,
sir, nor yet whae ye are; but this is a very poor employ for ony
gentleman&mdash;it sets ill wi&rsquo; ony gentleman to cast my
shame in my teeth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; Lord love you, my dear,
that ain&rsquo;t my line of country.&nbsp; Suppose you&rsquo;re
not married and churched a hundred thousand times, what odds to
Jerry Hunt?&nbsp; Jerry, my Pamela Prue, is a cove as might be
your parent; a cove renowned for the ladies&rsquo; friend [and
he&rsquo;s dead certain to be on your side].&nbsp; What I
can&rsquo;t get over is this: here&rsquo;s this Mr. Deacon Brodie
doing the genteel at home, and leaving a nice young &rsquo;oman
like you&mdash;as a cove may say&mdash;to take it out on cold
potatoes.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I can&rsquo;t get over, Mrs.
Watt.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a family man myself; and I can&rsquo;t get
over it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span>.&nbsp; And whae said that to
ye?&nbsp; They lee&rsquo;d whatever.&nbsp; I get naething but
guid by him; and I had nae richt to gang to his house; and O, I
just ken I&rsquo;ve been the ruin of him!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you take
on, Mrs. Watt.&nbsp; Why, now I hear you piping up for him, I
begin to think a lot of him myself.&nbsp; I like a cove to be
open-handed and free.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span>.&nbsp; Weel, sir, and
he&rsquo;s a&rsquo; that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; Well, that shows what a
wicked world this is.&nbsp; Why, they told me&mdash;.&nbsp; Well,
well, &lsquo;here&rsquo;s the open &rsquo;and and the &rsquo;appy
&rsquo;art.&rsquo;&nbsp; And how much, my dear&mdash;speaking as
a family man&mdash;now, how much might your gentleman friend
stand you in the course of a year?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s your
wull?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a mighty
fancy shawl, Mrs. Watt.&nbsp; [I should like to take its
next-door neighbour to Mrs. Hunt in King Street, Common
Garden.]&nbsp; What&rsquo;s about the figure?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s paid
for.&nbsp; Ye can sweir to that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; Yes, my dear, and so is
King George&rsquo;s crown; but I don&rsquo;t know what it cost,
and I don&rsquo;t know where the blunt came from to pay for
it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m thinking
ye&rsquo;ll be a vera clever gentleman.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; So I am, my dear; and I
like you none the worse for being artful yourself.&nbsp; But
between friends now, and speaking as a family man&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be
wishin&rsquo; ye a fine nicht.&nbsp; (<i>Curtsies and goes
out</i>.)</p>
<h5>SCENE IV</h5>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>
(<i>solus</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; Ah! that&rsquo;s it, is
it?&nbsp; &lsquo;My fancy man&rsquo;s my &rsquo;ole
delight,&rsquo; as we say in Bow Street.&nbsp; But which
<i>is</i> the fancy man?&nbsp; George the Dock, or William the
Deacon?&nbsp; One or both?&nbsp; (<i>He winks
solemnly</i>.)&nbsp; Well, Jerry, my boy, here&rsquo;s your work
cut out for you; but if you took one-nine-five for that
&rsquo;ere little two hundred you&rsquo;d be a disgrace to the
profession.</p>
<h4>TABLEAU III.<br />
<span class="smcap">Mother Clarke&rsquo;s</span></h4>
<h5>SCENE I</h5>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>The Stage represents a room of
coarse and sordid appearance</i>: <i>settles</i>,
<i>spittoons</i>, <i>etc.</i>; <i>sanded floor</i>.&nbsp; <i>A
large table at back</i>, <i>where</i> <span

<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got the
devil&rsquo;s own luck, Deacon, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve
got.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Luck!&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t talk of luck to a man like me!&nbsp; Why not say
I&rsquo;ve the devil&rsquo;s own judgment?&nbsp; Men of my stamp
don&rsquo;t risk&mdash;they plan, Badger; they plan, and leave
chance to such cattle as you [and Jingling Geordie.&nbsp; They
make opportunities before they take them].</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re artful,
ain&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Should I be here
else?&nbsp; When I leave my house I leave an <i>alibi</i> behind
me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m ill&mdash;ill with a jumping headache, and
the fiend&rsquo;s own temper.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sick in bed this
minute, and they&rsquo;re all going about with the fear of death
on them lest they should disturb the poor sick Deacon.&nbsp; [My
bedroom door is barred and bolted like the bank&mdash;you
remember!&mdash;and all the while the window&rsquo;s open, and
the Deacon&rsquo;s over the hills and far away.&nbsp; What do you
think of me?]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen your
sort before, I have.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Not you.&nbsp; As for
Leslie&rsquo;s&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; That was a nick above
you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Ay was it.&nbsp; He
wellnigh took me red-handed; and that was better luck than I
deserved.&nbsp; If I&rsquo;d not been drunk, and in my tantrums,
you&rsquo;d never have got my hand within a thousand years of
such a job.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re the King of the Cracksmen, ain&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Why not!&nbsp; He
asks me why not!&nbsp; Gods, what a brain it is!&nbsp; Hark ye,
Badger, it&rsquo;s all very well to be King of the Cracksmen, as
you call it; but however respectable he may have the misfortune
to be, one&rsquo;s friend is one&rsquo;s friend, and as such must
be severely let alone.&nbsp; What! shall there be no more honour
among thieves than there is honesty among politicians?&nbsp; Why,
man, if under heaven there were but one poor lock unpicked, and
that the lock of one whose claret you&rsquo;ve drunk, and who has
babbled of woman across your own mahogany&mdash;that lock, sir,
were entirely sacred.&nbsp; Sacred as the Kirk of Scotland;
sacred as King George upon his throne; sacred as the memory of
Bruce and Bannockburn.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; Oh, rot!&nbsp; I
ain&rsquo;t a parson, I ain&rsquo;t; I never had no college
education.&nbsp; Business is business.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
wot&rsquo;s the matter with me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Ay, so we said when
you lost that fight with Newcastle Jemmy, and sent us all home
poor men.&nbsp; That was a nick above <i>you</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; Newcastle Jemmy!&nbsp;
Muck: that&rsquo;s my opinion of him: muck.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll mop
the floor up with him any day, if so be as you or any on
&rsquo;em &rsquo;ll make it worth my while.&nbsp; If not,
muck!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my motto.&nbsp; Wot I now ses is, about
that &rsquo;ere crib at Leslie&rsquo;s, wos I right, I ses? or
wos I wrong?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s wot&rsquo;s the matter with
you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; You are both right
and wrong.&nbsp; You dared me to do it.&nbsp; I was drunk; I was
upon my mettle; and I as good as did it.&nbsp; More than that,
black-guardly as it was, I enjoyed the doing.&nbsp; He is my
friend.&nbsp; He had dined with me that day, and I felt like a
man in a story.&nbsp; I climbed his wall, I crawled along his
pantry roof, I mounted his window-sill.&nbsp; That one turn of my
wrist&mdash;you know it I&mdash;and the casement was open.&nbsp;
It was as dark as the pit, and I thought I&rsquo;d won my wager,
when, phewt! down went something inside, and down went somebody
with it.&nbsp; I made one leap, and was off like a rocket.&nbsp;
It was my poor friend in person; and if he&rsquo;d caught and
passed me on to the watchman under the window, I should have felt
no viler rogue than I feel just now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; I s&rsquo;pose he
knows you pretty well by this time?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the worst
of friendship.&nbsp; Here, Kirsty, fill these glasses.&nbsp;
Moore, here&rsquo;s better luck&mdash;and a more honourable
plant!&mdash;next time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; Deacon, I looks
towards you.&nbsp; But it looks thundering like rotten eggs,
don&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; I think not.&nbsp; I
was masked, for one thing, and for another I was as quick as
lightning.&nbsp; He suspects me so little that he dined with me
this very afternoon.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; Anyway, you
ain&rsquo;t game to try it on again, I&rsquo;ll lay odds on
that.&nbsp; Once bit, twice shy.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s your
motto.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Right again.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll put my <i>alibi</i> to a better use.&nbsp; And,
Badger, one word in your ear: there&rsquo;s no Newcastle Jemmy
about <i>me</i>.&nbsp; Drop the subject, and for good, or I shall
drop you.&nbsp; (<i>He rises</i>, <i>and walks backwards and
forwards</i>, <i>a little unsteadily</i>.&nbsp; <i>Then
returns</i>, <i>and sits L.</i>, <i>as before</i>.)</p>

mean business, I do.&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">Hunt</span>
<i>looks up at the name of</i> &lsquo;<i>Deacon</i>.&rsquo;)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Gad, Badger, I never
meet you that you do not.&nbsp; [You have a set of the most
commercial intentions!]&nbsp; You make me blush.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all
blazing fine, that is!&nbsp; But wot I ses is, wot about the
chips?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I ses.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m after that
thundering old Excise Office, I am.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my
motto.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a very
good motto, and at your lips, Badger, it kind of warms my
heart.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s not mine.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; Muck! why not?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis too big
and too dangerous.&nbsp; I shirk King George; he has a fat
pocket, but he has a long arm.&nbsp; [You pilfer sixpence from
him, and it&rsquo;s three hundred reward for you, and a hue and
cry from Tophet to the stars.]&nbsp; It ceases to be business; it
turns politics, and I&rsquo;m not a politician, Mr. Moore.&nbsp;
(<i>Rising</i>.)&nbsp; I&rsquo;m only Deacon Brodie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; I can
wait.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span> (<i>seeing</i> <span

a patch!&nbsp; [There&rsquo;s nothing under heaven I like so
dearly as a new face with a patch.]&nbsp; Who the devil, sir, are
you that own it?&nbsp; And where did you get it?&nbsp; And how
much will you take for it second-hand?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; Well, sir, to tell you
the truth (<span class="smcap">Brodie</span> <i>bows</i>)
it&rsquo;s not for sale.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s my own, and
I&rsquo;ll drink your honour&rsquo;s health in anything.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; An Englishman,

what part of southern Scotland do you come from?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; Well, your honour, to

<p>[<span class="smcap">Brodie</span> (<i>bowing</i>).&nbsp; Your

And those bells go on . . . go on! . . . inexorable as death and

different; I but to come the day, Deacon, though I ken fine
it&rsquo;s the Sabbath, and I think shame to be seen upon the

<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Said?&nbsp; Said
what?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span>.&nbsp; Just that ye were a

the hinder end he just speired straucht out, whaur it was ye got
your siller frae.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Where I got my
siller?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span>.&nbsp; Ay, that was it!&nbsp;
&lsquo;You ken,&rsquo; says he.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Did he? and what said
you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span>.&nbsp; I couldna think on
naething, but just that he was a gey and clever gentleman.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; You should have said
I was in trade, and had a good business.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what
you should have said.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what you would have said
had you been worth your salt.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s blunder,
blunder, outside and in [upstairs, downstairs, and in my

Smith?</p>

Procurator, but I&rsquo;ll take your word for it.&nbsp; Is she
not a tenant of yours?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Ay, ay; a bit house
on my land in Liberton&rsquo;s Wynd.&nbsp; Her man&rsquo;s awa,
puir body; or they tell me sae; and I&rsquo;m concerned for her
[she&rsquo;s unco bonnie to be left her lane].&nbsp; But it sets
me brawly to be finding faut wi&rsquo; the puir lass, and me an
elder, and should be at the plate.&nbsp; [There&rsquo;ll be twa
words about this in the Kirk Session.]&nbsp; However, it&rsquo;s
nane of my business that brings me, or I should tak&rsquo; the
mair shame to mysel&rsquo;.&nbsp; Na, sir, it&rsquo;s for you;
it&rsquo;s your business keeps me frae the kirk.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; My business,
Procurator?&nbsp; I rejoice to see it in such excellent
hands.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Ye see, it&rsquo;s
this way.&nbsp; I had a crack wi&rsquo; the laddie, Leslie,
<i>inter pocula</i> (he took a stirrup-cup wi&rsquo; me), and he
tells me he has askit Mary, and she was to speak to ye
hersel&rsquo;.&nbsp; O, ye needna look sae gash.&nbsp; Did she
speak? and what&rsquo;ll you have said to her?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; She has not spoken; I
have said nothing; and I believe I asked you to avoid the
subject.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Ay, I made a note
o&rsquo; that observation, William [and assoilzied
mysel&rsquo;].&nbsp; Mary&rsquo;s a guid lass, and I&rsquo;m her
uncle, and I&rsquo;m here to be answered.&nbsp; Is it to be ay or
no?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s to be
no.&nbsp; This marriage must be quashed; and hark ye, Procurator,
you must help me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Me? ye&rsquo;re
daft!&nbsp; And what for why?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Because I&rsquo;ve
spent the trust-money, and I can&rsquo;t refund it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Ye reprobate
deevil!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Have a care,
Procurator.&nbsp; No wry words!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Do you say it to my
face, sir?&nbsp; Dod, sir, I&rsquo;m the Crown Prosecutor.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; The
Prosecutor for the Crown.&nbsp; And where did you get your
brandy?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Eh?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Your brandy!&nbsp;
Your brandy man!&nbsp; Where do you get your brandy?&nbsp; And
you a Crown official and an elder!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Whaur the deevil did
ye hear that?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Rogues all!&nbsp;
Rogues all, Procurator!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Ay, ay.&nbsp; Lord
save us!&nbsp; Guidsake, to think o&rsquo; that noo! . . . Can ye
give me some o&rsquo; that Cognac?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m . . .
I&rsquo;m sort o&rsquo; shaken, William, I&rsquo;m sort o&rsquo;
shaken.&nbsp; Thank you, William! (<i>Looking</i>, <i>piteously
at glass</i>.)&nbsp; <i>Nunc est bibendum</i>.&nbsp;
(<i>Drinks</i>.)&nbsp; Troth, I&rsquo;m set ajee a bit.&nbsp; Wha
the deevil tauld ye?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Ask no questions,
brother.&nbsp; We are a pair.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Pair, indeed!&nbsp;
Pair, William Brodie!&nbsp; Upon my saul, sir, ye&rsquo;re a
brazen-faced man that durst say it to my face!&nbsp; Tak&rsquo;
you care, my bonnie young man, that your craig doesna feel the
wecht o&rsquo; your hurdies.&nbsp; Keep the plainstanes side
o&rsquo; the gallows.&nbsp; <i>Via trita</i>, <i>via tuta</i>,
William Brodie!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; And the brandy,
Procurator? and the brandy?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Ay . . . weel . . .
be&rsquo;t sae!&nbsp; Let the brandy bide, man, let the brandy
bide!&nbsp; But for you and the trust-money . . . damned!&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s felony.&nbsp; <i>Tutor in rem suam</i>, ye ken,
<i>tutor in rem suam</i>.&nbsp; But O man, Deacon, whaur is the
siller?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
gone&mdash;O how the devil should I know?&nbsp; But it&rsquo;ll
never come back.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Dear, dear!&nbsp;
A&rsquo; gone to the winds o&rsquo; heaven!&nbsp; Sae ye&rsquo;re
an extravagant dog, too.&nbsp; <i>Prodigus et furiosus</i>!&nbsp;
And that puir lass&mdash;eh, Deacon, man, that puir lass!&nbsp; I
mind her such a bonny bairn.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span> (<i>stopping his
ears</i>).&nbsp; Brandy, brandy, brandy, brandy, brandy</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; William Brodie,
mony&rsquo;s the long day that I&rsquo;ve believed in you; prood,
prood was I to be the Deacon&rsquo;s uncle; and a sore hearing
have I had of it the day.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s past; that&rsquo;s
past like Flodden Field; it&rsquo;s an auld sang noo, and
I&rsquo;m an aulder man than when I crossed your door. But mark
ye this&mdash;mark ye this, William Brodie, I may be no sae
guid&rsquo;s I should be; but there&rsquo;s no a saul between the
east sea and the wast can lift his een to God that made him, and
say I wranged him as ye wrang that lassie.&nbsp; I bless God,
William Brodie&mdash;ay, though he was like my brother&mdash;I
bless God that he that got ye has the hand of death upon his
hearing, and can win into his grave a happier man than me.&nbsp;
And ye speak to me, sir?&nbsp; Think shame&mdash;think shame upon
your heart!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Rogues all!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re the son
of my sister, William Brodie.&nbsp; Mair than that I stop not to
inquire.&nbsp; If the siller is spent, and the honour
tint&mdash;Lord help us, and the honour tint!&mdash;sae be it, I
maun bow the head.&nbsp; Ruin shallna come by me.&nbsp; Na, and
I&rsquo;ll say mair, William; we have a&rsquo; our weary sins
upon our backs, and maybe I have mair than mony.&nbsp; But, man,
if ye could bring <i>half</i> the jointure . . . [<i>potius quam
pereas</i>] . . . for your mither&rsquo;s son?&nbsp; Na?&nbsp;
You couldna bring the half?&nbsp; Weel, weel, it&rsquo;s a sair
heart I have this day, a sair heart and a weary.&nbsp; If I were
a better man mysel&rsquo; . . . but there, there, it&rsquo;s a
sair heart that I have gotten.&nbsp; And the Lord kens I&rsquo;ll
help ye if I can.&nbsp; [<i>Potius quam pereas</i>.]</p>
<h5>SCENE V</h5>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Sore hearing, does he
say?&nbsp; My hand&rsquo;s wet.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s
victory.&nbsp; Shall it be go? or stay?&nbsp; [I should show them
all I can, or they may pry closer than they ought.]&nbsp; Shall I
have it out and be done with it?&nbsp; To see Mary at once [to
carry bastion after bastion at the charge]&mdash;there were the
true safety after all!&nbsp; Hurry&mdash;hurry&rsquo;s the road
to silence now.&nbsp; Let them once get tattling in their
parlours, and it&rsquo;s death to me.&nbsp; For I&rsquo;m in a
cruel corner now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m down, and I shall get my
kicking soon and soon enough.&nbsp; I began it in the lust of
life, in a hey-day of mystery and adventure.&nbsp; I felt it
great to be a bolder, craftier rogue than the drowsy citizen that
called himself my fellow-man.&nbsp; [It was meat and drink to
know him in the hollow of my hand, hoarding that I and mine might
squander, pinching that we might wax fat.]&nbsp; It was in the
laughter of my heart that I tip-toed into his greasy
privacy.&nbsp; I forced the strong-box at his ear while he
sprawled beside his wife.&nbsp; He was my butt, my ape, my
jumping-jack.&nbsp; And now . . . O fool, fool!&nbsp; [Duped by
such knaves as are a shame to knavery, crime&rsquo;s rabble,
hell&rsquo;s tatterdemalions!]&nbsp; Shorn to the quick!&nbsp;
Rooked to my vitals!&nbsp; And I must thieve for my daily bread
like any crawling blackguard in the gutter.&nbsp; And my sister .
. . my kind, innocent sister!&nbsp; She will come smiling to me
with her poor little love-story, and I must break her
heart.&nbsp; Broken hearts, broken lives! . . . I should have
died before.</p>
<h5>SCENE VI</h5>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>,
<span class="smcap">Mary</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>tapping
without</i>).&nbsp; Can I come in, Will?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; O yes, come in, come
in!&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>enters</i>.)&nbsp;
I wanted to be quiet, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter, I see.&nbsp;
You women are all the same.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; O no, Will,
they&rsquo;re not all so happy, and they&rsquo;re not all
Brodies.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll be a woman in one thing.&nbsp; For
I&rsquo;ve come to claim your promise, dear; and I&rsquo;m going
to be petted and comforted and made much of, altho&rsquo; I
don&rsquo;t need it, and . . . Why, Will, what&rsquo;s wrong with
you?&nbsp; You look . . . I don&rsquo;t know what you look
like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; O nothing!&nbsp; A
splitting head and an aching heart.&nbsp; Well! you&rsquo;ve come
to speak to me.&nbsp; Speak up.&nbsp; What is it?&nbsp; Come,
girl!&nbsp; What is it?&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you speak?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Why, Will, what is the
matter?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; I thought you had
come to tell me something.&nbsp; Here I am.&nbsp; For God&rsquo;s
sake out with it, and don&rsquo;t stand beating about the
bush.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; O be kind, be kind to
me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Kind?&nbsp; I am
kind.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m only ill and worried, can&rsquo;t you
see?&nbsp; Whimpering?&nbsp; I knew it!&nbsp; Sit down, you
goose!&nbsp; Where do you women get your tears?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Why are you so cross
with me?&nbsp; Oh, Will, you have forgot your sister!&nbsp;
Remember, dear, that I have nobody but you.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s your
own fault, Will, if you&rsquo;ve taught me to come to you for
kindness, for I always found it.&nbsp; And I mean you shall be
kind to me again.&nbsp; I know you will, for this is my great
need, and the day I&rsquo;ve missed my mother sorest.&nbsp; Just
a nice look, dear, and a soft tone in your voice, to give me
courage, for I can tell you nothing till I know that you&rsquo;re
my own brother once again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;d take a
hint, you&rsquo;d put it off till to-morrow.&nbsp; But I suppose
you won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; On, then, I&rsquo;m listening.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m listening!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Mr. Leslie has asked me
to be his wife.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; He has, has he?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; And I have
consented.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; And . . . ?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; You can say that to
me?&nbsp; And that is all you have to say?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; O no, not all.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Speak out, sir.&nbsp; I
am not afraid.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; I suppose you want my
consent?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Can you ask?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t
know.&nbsp; You seem to have got on pretty well without it so
far.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; O shame on you! shame
on you!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Perhaps you may be
able to do without it altogether.&nbsp; I hope so.&nbsp; For
you&rsquo;ll never have it. . . . Mary! . . . I hate to see you
look like that.&nbsp; If I could say anything else, believe me, I
would say it.&nbsp; But I have said all; every word is spoken;
there&rsquo;s the end.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; It shall not be the
end.&nbsp; You owe me explanation; and I&rsquo;ll have it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t my
&lsquo;No&rsquo; enough, Mary?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; It might be enough for
me; but it is not, and it cannot be, enough for him.&nbsp; He has
asked me to be his wife; he tells me his happiness is in my
hands&mdash;poor hands, but they shall not fail him, if my poor
heart should break!&nbsp; If he has chosen and set his hopes upon
me, of all women in the world, I shall find courage somewhere to
be worthy of the choice.&nbsp; And I dare you to leave this room
until you tell me all your thoughts&mdash;until you prove that
this is good and right.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Good and right?&nbsp;
They are strange words, Mary.&nbsp; I mind the time when it was
good and right to be your father&rsquo;s daughter and your
brother&rsquo;s sister . . . Now! . . .</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Have I changed?&nbsp;
Not even in thought.&nbsp; My father, Walter says, shall live and
die with us.&nbsp; He shall only have gained another son.&nbsp;
And you&mdash;you know what he thinks of you; you know what I
would do for you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Give him up.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; I have told you: not
without a reason.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; You must.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; I will not.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; What if I told you
that you could only compass your happiness and his at the price
of my ruin?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Your ruin?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Even so.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Ruin!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; It has an ugly sound,
has it not?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; O Willie, what have you
done?&nbsp; What have you done?&nbsp; What have you done?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; I cannot tell you,
Mary.&nbsp; But you may trust me.&nbsp; You must give up this
Leslie . . . and at once.&nbsp; It is to save me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; I would die for you,
dear, you know that.&nbsp; But I cannot be false to him.&nbsp;
Even for you, I cannot be false to him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; We shall see.&nbsp;
Let me take you to your room.&nbsp; Come.&nbsp; And, remember, it
is for your brother&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; It is to save me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; I am true Brodie.&nbsp;
Give me time, and you shall not find me wanting.&nbsp; But it is
all so sudden . . . so strange and dreadful!&nbsp; You will give
me time, will you not?&nbsp; I am only a woman, and . . . O my
poor Walter!&nbsp; It will break his heart!&nbsp; It will break
his heart!&nbsp; (<i>A knock</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; You hear!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Yes, yes.&nbsp; Forgive
me.&nbsp; I am going.&nbsp; I will go.&nbsp; It is to save you,
is it not?&nbsp; To save you.&nbsp; Walter . . . Mr. Leslie . . .
O Deacon, Deacon, God forgive you!&nbsp; (<i>She goes
out</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Amen.&nbsp; But will
He?</p>
<h5>SCENE VII</h5>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>, <span
class="smcap">Hunt</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span> (<i>hat in hand</i>).&nbsp;
Mr. Deacon Brodie, I believe?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; I am he,
Mr.&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; Hunt, sir; an officer
from Sir John Fielding of Bow Street.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; There can be no
better passport than the name.&nbsp; In what can I serve you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll excuse me,
Mr. Deacon.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Your duty excuses
you, Mr. Hunt.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; Your obedient.&nbsp;
The fact is, Mr. Deacon [we in the office see a good deal of the
lives of private parties; and I needn&rsquo;t tell a gentleman of
your experience it&rsquo;s part of our duty to hold our
tongues.&nbsp; Now], it&rsquo;s come to my knowledge that you are
a trifle jokieous.&nbsp; Of course I know there ain&rsquo;t any
harm in that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been young myself, Mr. Deacon, and
speaking&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; O, but pardon
me.&nbsp; Mr. Hunt, I am not going to discuss my private
character with you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; To be sure you
ain&rsquo;t.&nbsp; [And do I blame you?&nbsp; Not me.]&nbsp; But,
speaking as one man of the world to another, you naturally see a
great deal of bad company.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Not half so much as
you do.&nbsp; But I see what you&rsquo;re driving at; and if I
can illuminate the course of justice, you may command me.&nbsp;
(<i>He sits</i>, <i>and motions</i> <span
class="smcap">Hunt</span> <i>to do likewise</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; I was dead sure of it;
and &rsquo;and upon &rsquo;art, Mr. Deacon, I thank you.&nbsp;
Now (<i>consulting pocket-book</i>), did you ever meet a certain
George Smith?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; The fellow they call
Jingling Geordie?&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">Hunt</span>
<i>nods</i>.)&nbsp; Yes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; Bad character.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Let us say . . .
disreputable.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; Any means of
livelihood?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; I really cannot
pretend to guess, I have met the creature at cock-fights [which,
as you know, are my weakness].&nbsp; Perhaps he bets.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; [Mr. Deacon, from what
I know of the gentleman, I should say that if he
don&rsquo;t&mdash;if he ain&rsquo;t open to any mortal
thing&mdash;he ain&rsquo;t the man I mean.]&nbsp; He used to be
about with a man called Badger Moore.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; The boxer?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s him.&nbsp;
Know anything of him?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Not much.&nbsp; I
lost five pieces on him in a fight; and I fear he sold his
backers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; Speaking as one admirer
of the noble art to another, Mr. Deacon, the losers always
do.&nbsp; I suppose the Badger cockfights like the rest of
us?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; I have met him in the
pit.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; Well, it&rsquo;s a
pretty sport.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m as partial to a main as
anybody.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not an
elegant taste, Mr. Hunt.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; It costs as much as
though it was.&nbsp; And that reminds me, speaking as one
sportsman to another, Mr. Deacon, I was sorry to hear that
you&rsquo;ve been dropping a hatful of money lately.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; You are very
good.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; Four hundred in three
months, they tell me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Ah!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; So they say, sir.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; They have a perfect
right to say so, Mr. Hunt.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; And you to do the other
thing?&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;m a good hand at keeping close
myself.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; I am not consulting
you, Mr. Hunt; &rsquo;tis you who are consulting me.&nbsp; And if
there is nothing else (<i>rising</i>) in which I can pretend to
serve you . . . ?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span> (<i>rising</i>).&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s about all, sir, unless you can put me on to anything
good in the way of heckle and spur?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d try to look
in.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; O, come, Mr. Hunt, if
you have nothing to do, frankly and flatly I have.&nbsp; This is
not the day for such a conversation; and so good-bye to
you.&nbsp; (<i>A knocking</i>, <i>C.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; Servant, Mr.
Deacon.&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">Smith</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Moore</span>, <i>without waiting to be
answered</i>, <i>open and enter</i>, <i>C.</i>&nbsp; <i>They are
well into the room before they observe</i> <span
class="smcap">Hunt</span>.)&nbsp; [Talk of the Devil, sir!]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; What brings you
here?&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">Smith</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Moore</span>, <i>confounded by the officer&rsquo;s
presence</i>, <i>slouch together to right of door</i>.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Hunt</span>, <i>stopping as he goes out</i>,
<i>contemplates the pair</i>, <i>sarcastically</i>.&nbsp; <i>This
is supported by</i> <span class="smcap">Moore</span> <i>with
sullen bravado</i>; <i>by</i> <span class="smcap">Smith</span>,
<i>with cringing airiness</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span> (<i>digging</i> <span
class="smcap">Smith</span> <i>in the ribs</i>).&nbsp; Why, you
are the very parties I was looking for!&nbsp; (<i>He goes
out</i>, <i>C.</i>)</p>
<h5>SCENE VIII</h5>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>, <span
class="smcap">Moore</span>, <span class="smcap">Smith</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; Wot was that cove here
about?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span> (<i>with folded arms</i>,
<i>half-sitting on bench</i>).&nbsp; He was here about you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span> (<i>still quite
discountenanced</i>).&nbsp; About us?&nbsp; Scissors!&nbsp; And
what did you tell him?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span> (<i>same
attitude</i>).&nbsp; I spoke of you as I have found you.&nbsp; [I
told him you were a disreputable hound, and that Moore had
crossed a fight.]&nbsp; I told him you were a drunken ass, and
Moore an incompetent and dishonest boxer.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; Look here,
Deacon!&nbsp; Wot&rsquo;s up?&nbsp; Wot I ses is, if a
cove&rsquo;s got any thundering grudge agin a cove, why
can&rsquo;t he spit it out, I ses.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Here are my answers
(<i>producing purse and dice</i>).&nbsp; These are both too
light.&nbsp; This purse is empty, these dice are not
loaded.&nbsp; Is it indiscretion to inquire how you share?&nbsp;
Equal with the Captain, I presume?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s as easy as
my eye, Deakin.&nbsp; Slink Ainslie got letting the merry glass
go round, and didn&rsquo;t know the right bones from the
wrong.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s <i>h</i>all.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; [What clumsy liars
you are!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; In boyhood&rsquo;s
hour, Deakin, he were called Old Truthful.&nbsp; Little did he
think&mdash;]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; What is your
errand?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; Business.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; After the melancholy
games of last night, Deakin, which no one deplores so much as
George Smith, we thought we&rsquo;d trot round&mdash;didn&rsquo;t
us, Hump? and see how you and your bankers was a-getting on.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Will you tell me your
errand?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re dry,
ain&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Am I?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; We ain&rsquo;t none of
us got a stiver, that&rsquo;s wot&rsquo;s the matter with us.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Is it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; Ay, strike me, it
is!&nbsp; And wot we&rsquo;ve got to is to put up the Excise.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the last
plant in the shrubbery Deakin, and it&rsquo;s breaking George the
gardener&rsquo;s heart, it is.&nbsp; We really must!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Must we?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; Must&rsquo;s the
thundering word.&nbsp; I mean business, I do.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
lucky.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; O, you don&rsquo;t,
don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; I do not.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; Then p&rsquo;raps
you&rsquo;ll tell us wot you thundering well do?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; What do I mean?&nbsp;
I mean that you and that merry-andrew shall walk out of this room
and this house.&nbsp; Do you suppose, you blockheads, that I am
blind?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m the Deacon, am I not?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
been your king and your commander.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve led you, and
fed you, and thought for you with this head.&nbsp; And you think
to steal a march upon a man like me?&nbsp; I see you through and
through [I know you like the clock]; I read your thoughts like
print.&nbsp; Brodie, you thought, has money, and won&rsquo;t do
the job.&nbsp; Therefore, you thought, we must rook him to the
heart.&nbsp; And therefore, you put up your idiot cockney.&nbsp;
And now you come round, and dictate, and think sure of your
Excise?&nbsp; Sure?&nbsp; Are you sure I&rsquo;ll let you pack
with a whole skin?&nbsp; By my soul, but I&rsquo;ve a mind to
pistol you like dogs.&nbsp; Out of this!&nbsp; Out, I say, and
soil my home no more.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span> (<i>sitting</i>).&nbsp; Now
look &rsquo;ere.&nbsp; Mr. bloody Deacon Brodie, you see this
&rsquo;ere chair of yours, don&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; Wot I ses to
you is, here I am, I ses, and here I mean to stick.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s my motto.&nbsp; Who the devil are you to do the high
and mighty?&nbsp; You make all you can out of us, don&rsquo;t
you? and when one of your plants get cross, you order us out of
the ken?&nbsp; Muck!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s wot I think of you.&nbsp;
Muck!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you get coming the nob over me, Mr.
Deacon Brodie, or I&rsquo;ll smash you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; You will?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; Ay will I.&nbsp; If I
thundering well swing for it.&nbsp; And as for clearing
out?&nbsp; Muck!&nbsp; Here I am, and here I stick.&nbsp; Clear
out?&nbsp; You try it on.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a man, I am.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; This is plain
speaking.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; Plain?&nbsp; Wot about
your father as can&rsquo;t walk?&nbsp; Wot about your fine-madam
sister?&nbsp; Wot about the stone-jug, and the dock, and the rope
in the open street?&nbsp; Is that plain?&nbsp; If it ain&rsquo;t,
you let me know, and I&rsquo;ll spit it out so as it&rsquo;ll
raise the roof off this &rsquo;ere ken.&nbsp; Plain!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m that cove&rsquo;s master, and I&rsquo;ll make it plain
enough for him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; What do you want of
me?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; Wot do I want of
you?&nbsp; Now you speak sense.&nbsp; Leslie&rsquo;s is wot I
want of you.&nbsp; The Excise is wot I want of you.&nbsp;
Leslie&rsquo;s to-night and the Excise to-morrow.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s wot I want of you, and wot I thundering well mean to
get.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Damn you!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; Amen.&nbsp; But
you&rsquo;ve got your orders.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span> (<i>with pistol</i>).&nbsp;
Orders? hey? orders?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span> (<i>between them</i>).&nbsp;
Deacon, Deacon!&mdash;Badger, are you mad?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; Muck!&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s my motto.&nbsp; Wot I ses is, has he got his orders
or has he not?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s wot&rsquo;s the matter with
him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; Deacon, half a
tick.&nbsp; Humphrey, I&rsquo;m only a light weight, and you
fight at twelve stone ten, but I&rsquo;m damned if I&rsquo;m
going to stand still and see you hitting a pal when he&rsquo;s
down.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; Muck!&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s wot I think of you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a cut above
us, ain&rsquo;t he?&nbsp; He never sold his backers, did
he?&nbsp; We couldn&rsquo;t have done without him, could
we?&nbsp; You dry up about his old man, and his sister; and
don&rsquo;t go on hitting a pal when he&rsquo;s knocked out of
time and cannot hit back, for, damme, I will not stand it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; Amen to you.&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;m cock of this here thundering walk, and that
cove&rsquo;s got his orders.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span> (<i>putting pistol on
bench</i>).&nbsp; I give in.&nbsp; I will do your work for you
once more.&nbsp; Leslie&rsquo;s to-night and the Excise
to-morrow.&nbsp; If that is enough, if you have no more . . .
orders, you may count it as done.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; Fen larks.&nbsp; No
rotten shirking, mind.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; I have passed you my
word.&nbsp; And now you have said what you came to say, you must
go.&nbsp; I have business here; but two hours hence I am at your
. . . orders.&nbsp; Where shall I await you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; What about that
woman&rsquo;s place of yours?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Your will is my
law.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s good
enough.&nbsp; Now, Dock.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; Bye-bye, my
William.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t forget.</p>
<h5>SCENE IX</h5>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Trust me.&nbsp; No
man forgets his vice, you dogs, or forgives it either.&nbsp; It
must be done: Leslie&rsquo;s to-night and the Excise
to-morrow.&nbsp; It shall be done.&nbsp; This settles it.&nbsp;
They used to fetch and carry for me, and now . . . I&rsquo;ve
licked their boots, have I?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m their man, their
tool, their chattel.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the bottom rung of the
ladder of shame.&nbsp; I sound with my foot, and there&rsquo;s
nothing underneath but the black emptiness of damnation.&nbsp;
Ah, Deacon, Deacon, and so this is where you&rsquo;ve been
travelling all these years; and it&rsquo;s for this that you
learned French!&nbsp; The gallows . . . God help me, it begins to
dog me like my shadow.&nbsp; <i>There&rsquo;s</i> a step to
take!&nbsp; And the jerk upon your spine!&nbsp; How&rsquo;s a man
to die with a night-cap on?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve done with
this.&nbsp; Over yonder, across the great ocean, is a new land,
with new characters, and perhaps new lives.&nbsp; The sun shines,
and the bells ring, and it&rsquo;s a place where men live gladly;
and the Deacon himself can walk without terror, and begin again
like a new-born child.&nbsp; It must be good to see day again and
not to fear; it must be good to be one&rsquo;s self with all
men.&nbsp; Happy like a child, wise like a man, free like
God&rsquo;s angels . . . should I work these hands off and eat
crusts, there were a life to make me young and good again.&nbsp;
And it&rsquo;s only over the sea!&nbsp; O man, you have been
blind, and now your eyes are opened.&nbsp; It was half a
life&rsquo;s nightmare, and now you are awake.&nbsp; Up, Deacon,
up, it&rsquo;s hope that&rsquo;s at the window!&nbsp; Mary! Mary!
Mary!</p>
<h5>SCENE X</h5>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>, <span
class="smcap">Mary</span>, <span class="smcap">Old
Brodie</span></p>
<p>(<span class="smcap">Brodie</span> has fallen into a chair,
with his face upon the table.&nbsp; Enter <span
class="smcap">Mary</span>, by the side door pushing her
father&rsquo;s chair.&nbsp; She is supposed to have advanced far
enough for stage purposes before <span
class="smcap">Brodie</span> is aware of her.&nbsp; He starts up,
and runs to her.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Look up, my lass,
look up, and be a woman!&nbsp; I . . . O kiss me, Mary I give me
a kiss for my good news.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Good news, Will?&nbsp;
Is it changed?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Changed?&nbsp; Why,
the world&rsquo;s a different colour!&nbsp; It was night, and now
it&rsquo;s broad day and I trust myself again.&nbsp; You must
wait, dear, wait, and I must work and work; and before the week
is out, as sure as God sees me, I&rsquo;ll have made you
happy.&nbsp; O you may think me broken, hounds, but the
Deacon&rsquo;s not the man to be run down; trust him, he shall
turn a corner yet, and leave you snarling!&nbsp; And you, Poll,
you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve done nothing for you yet; but, please God,
I&rsquo;ll make your life a life of gold; and wherever I am,
I&rsquo;ll have a part in your happiness, and you&rsquo;ll know
it, by heaven! and bless me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; O Willie, look at him;
I think he hears you, and is trying to be glad with us.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; My
son&mdash;Deacon&mdash;better man than I was.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; O for God&rsquo;s
sake, hear him!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; He is quite happy,
Will, and so am I . . . so am I.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Hear me, Mary.&nbsp;
This is a big moment in our two lives.&nbsp; I swear to you by
the father here between us that it shall not be fault of mine if
this thing fails; if this ship founders you have set your hopes
in.&nbsp; I swear it by our father; I swear it by God&rsquo;s
judgments.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; I want no oaths,
Will.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; No, but I do.&nbsp;
And prayers, Mary, prayers.&nbsp; Pray night and day upon your
knees.&nbsp; I must move mountains.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Old Brodie</span>.&nbsp; A wise son
maketh&mdash;maketh&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; A glad father?&nbsp;
And does your son, the Deacon, make you glad?&nbsp; O heaven of
heavens, if I were a good man.</p>

<h4>TABLEAU V.<br />
<span class="smcap">King&rsquo;s Evidence</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>The Stage represents a public
place in Edinburgh</i>.</p>
<h5>SCENE I</h5>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Jean</span>,
<span class="smcap">Smith</span>, <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Moore</span></p>
<p>(<i>They loiter in L.</i>, <i>and stand looking about as for
somebody not there</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Smith</span>
<i>is hat in hand to</i> <span class="smcap">Jean</span>; <span
class="smcap">Moore</span> <i>as usual</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; Wot did I tell
you?&nbsp; Is he &rsquo;ere, or ain&rsquo;t he?&nbsp; Now,
then.&nbsp; Slink by name and Slink by nature, that&rsquo;s
wot&rsquo;s the matter with him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span>.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll no be lang;
he&rsquo;s regular enough, if that was a&rsquo;.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d regular him;
I&rsquo;d break his back.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; Badger, you brute, you
hang on to the lessons of your dancing-master.&nbsp; None but the
genteel deserves the fair; does they, Duchess?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; O rot!&nbsp; Did I
insult the blowen?&nbsp; Wot&rsquo;s the matter with me is Slink
Ainslie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; All right, old
Crossed-in-love.&nbsp; Give him forty winks, and he&rsquo;ll turn
up as fresh as clean sawdust and as respectable as a new
Bible.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right
enough; but I ain&rsquo;t agoing to stand here all day for
him.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m for a drop of something short, I am.&nbsp;
You tell him I showed you that (<i>showing his doubled
fist</i>).&nbsp; That&rsquo;s wot&rsquo;s the matter with
him.&nbsp; (<i>He lurches out</i>, <i>R.</i>)</p>
<h5>SCENE II</h5>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Smith</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Jean</span>, <i>to whom</i> <span
class="smcap">Hunt</span>, <i>and afterwards</i> <span
class="smcap">Moore</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span> (<i>critically</i>).&nbsp;
No, Duchess, he has not good manners.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span>.&nbsp; Ay, he&rsquo;s an
impident man.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; So he is, Jean; and
for the matter of that he ain&rsquo;t the only one.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span>.&nbsp; Geordie, I want nae
mair o&rsquo; your nonsense, mind.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s our old
particular the Deacon, now.&nbsp; Why is he ashamed of a lovely
woman?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s not my idea of the Young Chevalier,
Jean.&nbsp; If I had luck, we should be married, and retire to
our estates in the country, shouldn&rsquo;t us? and go to church
and be happy, like the nobility and gentry.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span>.&nbsp; Geordie Smith, div ye
mean ye&rsquo;d mairry me?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; Mean it?&nbsp; What
else has ever been the &rsquo;umble petition of your honest but
well-meaning friend, Roman, and fellow-countryman?&nbsp; I know
the Deacon&rsquo;s your man, and I know he&rsquo;s a cut above G.
S.; but he won&rsquo;t last, Jean, and I shall.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span>.&nbsp; Ay, I&rsquo;m muckle
ta&rsquo;en up wi&rsquo; him; wha could help it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; Well, and my sort
don&rsquo;t grow on apple-trees either.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span>.&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;re a fine,
cracky, neebourly body, Geordie, if ye wad just let me be.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; I know I ain&rsquo;t a
Scotchman born.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span>.&nbsp; I dinna think sae
muckle the waur o&rsquo; ye even for that; if ye would just let
me be.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Hunt</span> (<i>entering behind</i>,
<i>aside</i>).&nbsp; Are they thick?&nbsp; Anyhow, it&rsquo;s a
second chance.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; But he won&rsquo;t
last, Jean, and when he leaves you, you come to me.&nbsp; Is that
your taste in pastry?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the kind of harticle
that I present.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span> (<i>surprising them as in
Tableau I</i>.).&nbsp; Why, you&rsquo;re the very parties I was
looking for!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span>.&nbsp; Mercy me!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; Damn it, Jerry, this
is unkind.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; [Now this is what I
call a picter of good fortune.]&nbsp; Ain&rsquo;t it strange I
should have dropped across you comfortable and promiscuous like
this?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span> (<i>stolidly</i>).&nbsp; I
hope ye&rsquo;re middling weel, Mr. Hunt?&nbsp;
(<i>Going</i>.)&nbsp; Mr. Smith!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; Mrs. Watt,
ma&rsquo;am!&nbsp; (<i>Going</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; Hold hard,
George.&nbsp; Speaking as one lady&rsquo;s man to another, turn
about&rsquo;s fair play.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve had your confab, and
now I&rsquo;m going to have mine.&nbsp; [Not that I&rsquo;ve done
with you; you stand by and wait.]&nbsp; Ladies first, George,
ladies first; that&rsquo;s the size of it.&nbsp; (<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Jean</span>, <i>aside</i>.)&nbsp; Now, Mrs. Watt, I
take it you ain&rsquo;t a natural fool?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span>.&nbsp; And thank ye kindly,
Mr. Hunt.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span> (<i>interfering</i>).&nbsp;
Jean . . . !</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span> (<i>keeping him
off</i>).&nbsp; Half a tick, George.&nbsp; (<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Jean</span>.)&nbsp; Mrs. Watt, I&rsquo;ve a warrant
in my pocket.&nbsp; One, two, three: will you peach?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span>.&nbsp; Whaten kind of a
word&rsquo;ll that be?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; Mum it is, Jean!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; <i>When</i>
you&rsquo;ve done dancing, George!&nbsp; (<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Jean</span>.)&nbsp; It ain&rsquo;t a pretty
expression, my dear, I own it.&nbsp; &lsquo;Will you blow the
gaff?&rsquo; is perhaps more tenderer.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span>.&nbsp; I think ye&rsquo;ve a
real strange way o&rsquo; expressin yoursel&rsquo;.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span> (<i>to</i> <span
class="smcap">Jean</span>).&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t waste time on
you, my girl.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s now or never.&nbsp; Will you turn
king&rsquo;s evidence?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span>.&nbsp; I think ye&rsquo;ll
have made a mistake, like.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;m . . . !
(<i>Separating them</i>.)&nbsp; [No, not yet; don&rsquo;t push
me.]&nbsp; George&rsquo;s turn now.&nbsp; (<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">George</span>.)&nbsp; George, I&rsquo;ve a warrant
in my pocket.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; As per usual,
Jerry?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; Now I want king&rsquo;s
evidence.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; Ah! so you came a
cropper with <i>her</i>, Jerry.&nbsp; Pride had a fall.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; A free pardon and fifty
shiners down.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; A free pardon,
Jerry?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t I tell you
so?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; And fifty down?
fifty?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; On the nail.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; So you came a cropper
with her, and then you tried it on with me?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; I suppose you mean
you&rsquo;re a born idiot?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; What I mean is, Jerry,
that you&rsquo;ve broke my heart.&nbsp; I used to look up to you
like a party might to Julius C&aelig;sar.&nbsp; One more of
boyhood&rsquo;s dreams gone pop.&nbsp; (<i>Enter</i> <span
class="smcap">Moore</span>, <i>L.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span> (<i>to both</i>).&nbsp; Come,
then, I&rsquo;ll take the pair, and be damned to you.&nbsp; Free
pardon to both, fifty down and the Deacon out of the way.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t care for you commoners, it&rsquo;s the Deacon I
want.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span> (<i>looking off
stolidly</i>).&nbsp; I think the kirks are scalin&rsquo;.&nbsp;
There seems to be mair people in the streets.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; O that&rsquo;s the way,
is it?&nbsp; Do you know that I can hang you, my woman, and your
fancy man a well?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span>.&nbsp; I daur say ye would
like fine, Mr. Hunt; and here&rsquo;s my service to you.&nbsp;
(<i>Going</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; George, don&rsquo;t you
be a tomfool, anyway.&nbsp; Think of the blowen here, and have
brains for two.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span> (<i>going</i>).&nbsp; Ah,
Jerry, if you knew anything, how different you would talk!&nbsp;
(<i>They go together</i>, <i>R.</i>)</p>
<h5>SCENE III</h5>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>,
<span class="smcap">Moore</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; Half a tick,
Badger.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a man of parts, you are; you&rsquo;re
solid, you&rsquo;re a true-born Englishman; you ain&rsquo;t a
Jerry-go-Nimble like him.&nbsp; Do you know what your pal the
Deacon&rsquo;s worth to you?&nbsp; Fifty golden Georges and a
free pardon.&nbsp; No questions asked, and no receipts
demanded.&nbsp; What do you say?&nbsp; Is it a deal?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span> (<i>as to himself</i>).&nbsp;
Muck.&nbsp; (<i>He goes out</i>, <i>R.</i>)</p>
<h5>SCENE IV</h5>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>,
<i>to whom</i> <span class="smcap">Ainslie</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span> (<i>looking after them
ruefully</i>).&nbsp; And these were the very parties I was
looking for!&nbsp; [Ah, Jerry, Jerry, if they knew this at the
office!]&nbsp; Well, the market price of that &rsquo;ere two
hundred is a trifle on the decline and fall.&nbsp; (<i>Looking
L.</i>)&nbsp; Hullo!&nbsp; (<i>Slapping his thigh</i>).&nbsp;
Send me victorious!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s king&rsquo;s evidence on two
legs.&nbsp; (<i>Advancing with great cordiality to meet</i> <span
class="smcap">Ainslie</span>, <i>who enters L.</i>)&nbsp; And so
your name&rsquo;s Andrew Ainslie, is it?&nbsp; As I was saying,
you&rsquo;re the very party I was looking for.&nbsp; Ain&rsquo;t
it strange, now, that I should have dropped across you
comfortable and promiscuous like this?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ainslie</span>.&nbsp; I dinna ken wha ye
are, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m ill for my bed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; Let your bed wait,
Andrew.&nbsp; I want a little chat with you; just a quiet little
sociable wheeze.&nbsp; Just about our friends, you know.&nbsp;
About Badger Moore, and George the Dook, and Jemmy Rivers, and
Deacon Brodie, Andrew.&nbsp; Particularly Deacon Brodie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ainslie</span>.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re nae
friens o&rsquo; mine&rsquo;s, mister.&nbsp; I ken naething
an&rsquo; naebody.&nbsp; An&rsquo; noo I&rsquo;ll get to my bed,
wulln&rsquo;t I?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re going to
have our little talk out first.&nbsp; After that perhaps
I&rsquo;ll let you go, and perhaps I won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; It all
depends on how we get along together.&nbsp; Now, in a general
way, Andrew, and speaking of a man as you find him, I&rsquo;m all
for peace and quietness myself.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my usual game,
Andrew, but when I do make a dust I&rsquo;m considered by my
friends to be rather a good hand at it.&nbsp; So don&rsquo;t you
tread upon the worm.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ainslie</span>.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m
sayin&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; You leave that to me,
Andrew.&nbsp; You shall do your pitch presently.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
first on the ground, and I lead off.&nbsp; With a question,
Andrew.&nbsp; Did you ever hear in your life of such a natural
curiosity as a Bow Street Runner?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ainslie</span>.&nbsp; Aiblins ay an&rsquo;
aiblins no.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; &lsquo;Aiblins ay and
aiblins no.&rsquo;&nbsp; Very good indeed, Andrew.&nbsp; Now,
I&rsquo;ll ask you another.&nbsp; Did you ever see a Bow Street
Runner, Andrew?&nbsp; With the naked eye, so to speak?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ainslie</span>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s your
wull?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; Artful bird!&nbsp; Now
since we&rsquo;re getting on so cosy <i>and</i> so free,
I&rsquo;ll ask you another, Andrew.&nbsp; Should you like to see
a Bow Street Runner?&nbsp; (<i>Producing staff</i>.)&nbsp;
&rsquo;Cos, if so, you&rsquo;ve only got to cast your eyes on
me.&nbsp; Do you queer the red weskit, Andrew?&nbsp; Pretty
colour, ain&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; So nice and warm for the winter
too.&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">Ainslie</span> <i>dives</i>,
<span class="smcap">Hunt</span> <i>collars him</i>.)&nbsp; No,
you don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Not this time.&nbsp; Run away like that
before we&rsquo;ve finished our little conversation?&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re a nice young man, you are.&nbsp; Suppose we
introduce our wrists into these here darbies?&nbsp; Now we shall
get along cosier and freer than ever.&nbsp; Want to lie down, do
you?&nbsp; All right! anything to oblige.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ainslie</span> (<i>grovelling</i>).&nbsp;
It wasna me, it wasna me.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s bad companions;
I&rsquo;ve been lost wi&rsquo; bad companions an&rsquo; the
drink.&nbsp; An&rsquo; O mister, ye&rsquo;ll be a kind gentleman
to a puir lad, an&rsquo; me sae weak, an&rsquo; fair rotten
wi&rsquo; the drink an&rsquo; that.&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;ve a bonnie
kind heart, my dear, dear gentleman; ye wadna hang sitchan a
thing as me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m no fit to hang.&nbsp; They ca&rsquo;
me the Cannleworm!&nbsp; An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll dae somethin&rsquo;
for ye, wulln&rsquo;t I?&nbsp; An&rsquo; ye&rsquo;ll can hang the
ithers?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; I thought I
hadn&rsquo;t mistook my man.&nbsp; Now, you look here, Andrew
Ainslie, you&rsquo;re a bad lot.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve evidence to
hang you fifty times over.&nbsp; But the Deacon is my mark.&nbsp;
Will you peach, or wont you?&nbsp; You blow the gaff, and
I&rsquo;ll pull you through.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t, and
I&rsquo;ll scragg you as sure as my name&rsquo;s Jerry Hunt.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ainslie</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll dae
onything.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the hanging fleys me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
dae onything, onything no to hang.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t lie
crawling there, but get up and answer me like a man.&nbsp;
Ain&rsquo;t this Deacon Brodie the fine workman that&rsquo;s been
doing all these tip-topping burglaries?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ainslie</span>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s him,
mister; it&rsquo;s him.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the man.&nbsp;
Ye&rsquo;re in the very bit.&nbsp; Deacon Brodie.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll can tak&rsquo; ye to his vera door.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; How do you know?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ainslie</span>.&nbsp; I gi&rsquo;ed him a
han&rsquo; wi&rsquo; them a&rsquo;.&nbsp; It was him an&rsquo;
Badger Moore, and Geordie Smith; an&rsquo; they gart me gang
wi&rsquo; them whether or no; I&rsquo;m that weak, an&rsquo;
whiles I&rsquo;m donner&rsquo;d wi&rsquo; the drink.&nbsp; But I
ken a&rsquo;, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll tell a&rsquo;.&nbsp; And O
kind gentleman, you&rsquo;ll speak to their lordships for me,
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll no be hangit . . . I&rsquo;ll no be hangit,
wull I?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; But you shared,
didn&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; I wonder what share they thought you
worth.&nbsp; How much did you get for last night&rsquo;s
performance down at Mother Clarke&rsquo;s?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ainslie</span>.&nbsp; Just five pund,
mister.&nbsp; Five pund.&nbsp; As sure&rsquo;s deith it wadna be
a penny mair.&nbsp; No but I askit mair: I did that; I&rsquo;ll
do deny it, mister.&nbsp; But Badger kickit me, an&rsquo;
Geordie, he said a bad sweir, an&rsquo; made he&rsquo;d cut the
liver out o&rsquo; me, an&rsquo; catch fish wi&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s been that way frae the first: an aith an&rsquo; a
bawbee was aye guid eneuch for puir Andra.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; Well, and why did they
do it?&nbsp; I saw Jemmy dance a hornpipe on the table, and booze
the company all round, when the Deacon was gone.&nbsp; What made
you cross the fight, and play booty with your own man?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ainslie</span>.&nbsp; Just to make him rob
the Excise, mister.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re wicked, wicked men.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; And is he right for
it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ainslie</span>.&nbsp; Ay is he.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; By jingo!&nbsp;
When&rsquo;s it for?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ainslie</span>.&nbsp; Dear, kind
gentleman, I dinna rightly ken: the Deacon&rsquo;s that sair
angered wi&rsquo; me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m to get my orders frae
Geordie the nicht.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; O, you&rsquo;re to get
your orders from Geordie, are you?&nbsp; Now look here,
Ainslie.&nbsp; You know me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m Hunt the Runner; I
put Jemmy Rivers in the jug this morning; I&rsquo;ve got you this
evening.&nbsp; I mean to wind up with the Deacon.&nbsp; You
understand?&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Then just you listen.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m going to take these here bracelets off, and send you
home to that celebrated bed of yours.&nbsp; Only, as soon as
you&rsquo;ve seen the Dook you come straight round to me at Mr.
Procurator-Fiscal&rsquo;s, and let me know the Dook&rsquo;s
views.&nbsp; One word, mind, and . . . cl&rsquo;k!&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a bargain?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ainslie</span>.&nbsp; Never you fear
that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tak&rsquo; my bannet an&rsquo; come
straucht to ye.&nbsp; Eh God, I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s nae mair
nor that to start wi&rsquo;.&nbsp; An&rsquo; may the Lord bless
ye, dear, kind gentleman, for your kindness.&nbsp; May the Lord
bless ye.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span>.&nbsp; You pad the hoof.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ainslie</span> (<i>going out</i>).&nbsp;
An&rsquo; so I wull, wulln&rsquo;t I not?&nbsp; An&rsquo; bless,
bless ye while there&rsquo;s breath in my body, wulln&rsquo;t I
not?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hunt</span> (<i>solus</i>).&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re a nice young man, Andrew Ainslie.&nbsp; Jemmy Rivers
and the Deacon in two days!&nbsp; By jingo!&nbsp; (<i>He dances
an instant gravely</i>, <i>whistling to himself</i>.)&nbsp;
Jerry, that &rsquo;ere little two hundred of ours is as safe as
the bank.</p>

<h5>SCENE I</h5>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>, <span
class="smcap">Lawson</span>, <span class="smcap">Mary</span>,
<i>seated</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Brodie</span> <i>at
back</i>, <i>walking between the windows and strong-box</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Weel, weel, weel,
weel, nae doubt.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; Mr. Lawson, I am
perfectly satisfied with Brodie&rsquo;s word; I will wait
gladly.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; I have nothing to say
against that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span> (<i>behind</i> <span
class="smcap">Lawson</span>).&nbsp; Nor for it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; For it? for it,
William?&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;re perfectly richt there.&nbsp;
(<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.)&nbsp; Just you do
what William tells you; ye canna do better than that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Dear uncle, I see you
are vexed; but Will and I are perfectly agreed on the best
course.&nbsp; Walter and I are young.&nbsp; Oh, we can wait; we
can trust each other.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span> (<i>from behind</i>).&nbsp;
Leslie, do you think it safe to keep this strong-box in your
room?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; It does not trouble
me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; I would not.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis close to the window.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s on the
right side of it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; I give you my advice:
I would not.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; He may be right there
too, Mr. Leslie.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; I give him fair
warning: it&rsquo;s not safe</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; I have a different
treasure to concern myself about; if all goes right with that I
shall be well contented.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Walter!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Ay, bairns, ye speak
for your age.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; Surely, sir, for
every age; the ties of blood, of love, of friendship, these are
life&rsquo;s essence.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; And for no one is it
truer than my uncle.&nbsp; If he live to be a thousand, he will
still be young in heart, full of love, full of trust.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; All, lassie,
it&rsquo;s a wicked world.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Yes, you are out of
sorts to-day; we know that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; Admitted that you
know more of life, sir; admitted (if you please) that the world
is wicked; yet you do not lose trust in those you love.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Weel . . . ye get
gliffs, ye ken.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; I suppose so.&nbsp;
We can all be shaken for a time; but not, I think, in our
friends.&nbsp; We are not deceived in them; in the few that we
admit into our hearts.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Never in these.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; We know these
(<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Brodie</span>), and we think the
world of them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span> (<i>at back</i>).&nbsp; We
are more acquainted with each other&rsquo;s tailors, believe
me.&nbsp; You, Leslie, are a very pleasant creature.&nbsp; My
uncle Lawson is the Procurator-Fiscal.&nbsp; I&mdash;What am
I?&mdash;I am the Deacon of the Wrights, my ruffles are generally
clean.&nbsp; And you think the world of me?&nbsp; Bravo!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; Ay, and I think the
world of you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span> (<i>at back</i>, <i>pointing
to</i> <span class="smcap">Lawson</span>).&nbsp; Ask him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Hoot-toot.&nbsp; A
wheen nonsense: an honest man&rsquo;s an honest man, and a randy
thief&rsquo;s a randy thief, and neither mair nor less.&nbsp;
Mary, my lamb, it&rsquo;s time you were hame, and had you beauty
sleep.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Do you not come with
us?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; I gang the ither
gate, my lamb.&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">Leslie</span>
<i>helps</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>on with her
cloak</i>, <i>and they say farewell at back</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Brodie</span> <i>for the first time comes front
with</i> <span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.)&nbsp; Sae
ye&rsquo;ve consented?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; As you see.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;ll can pay
it back?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; I will.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; And how?&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m wonderin&rsquo; to mysel&rsquo;.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Ay, God knows
that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Come, Will.</p>
<h5>SCENE II</h5>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>,
<span class="smcap">Lawson</span> (<i>wrapping up</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; I wonder what ails
Brodie?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; How should I
ken?&nbsp; What should I ken that ails him?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; He seemed angry even
with you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span> (<i>impatient</i>).&nbsp;
Hoot awa&rsquo;.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; Of course, I
know.&nbsp; But you see, on the very day when our engagement is
announced, even the best of men may be susceptible.&nbsp; You
yourself seem not quite pleased.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span> (<i>with great
irritation</i>).&nbsp; I&rsquo;m perfectly pleased.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m perfectly delighted.&nbsp; If I werena an auld man,
I&rsquo;d be just beside mysel&rsquo; wi&rsquo; happiness.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; Well, I only
fancied.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Ye had nae possible
excuse to fancy.&nbsp; Fancy?&nbsp; Perfect trash and
nonsense.&nbsp; Look at yersel&rsquo;.&nbsp; Ye look like a
ghaist, ye&rsquo;re white-like, ye&rsquo;re black aboot the een;
and do ye find me deavin&rsquo; ye wi&rsquo; fancies?&nbsp; Or
William Brodie either?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll say that for him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not sorrow
that alters my complexion; I&rsquo;ve something else on
hand.&nbsp; Come, I&rsquo;ll tell you, under seal.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve not been in bed till daylight for a week.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Weel, there&rsquo;s
nae sense in the like o&rsquo; that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; Gad, but there is
though.&nbsp; Why, Procurator, this is town&rsquo;s business;
this is a municipal affair; I&rsquo;m a public character.&nbsp;
Why?&nbsp; Ah, here&rsquo;s a nut for the Crown Prosecutor!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m a bit of a party to a robbery.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Guid guide us, man,
what d&rsquo;ye mean?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; You shall hear.&nbsp;
A week ago to-night, I was passing through this very room without
a candle on my way to bed, when . . . what should I see, but a
masked man fumbling at that window!&nbsp; How he did the Lord
knows.&nbsp; I suspect, Procurator, it was not the first
he&rsquo;d tried . . . for he opened it as handily as his own
front door.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Preserve me!&nbsp;
Another of thae robberies!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
it.&nbsp; And, of course, I tried to seize him.&nbsp; But the
rascal was too quick.&nbsp; He was down and away in an
instant.&nbsp; You never saw a thing so daring and adroit.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Is that
a&rsquo;?&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;re a bauld lad, I&rsquo;ll say that for
ye.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad it wasna waur.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; Yes, that&rsquo;s all
plain sailing.&nbsp; But here&rsquo;s the hitch.&nbsp; Why
didn&rsquo;t I tell the Procurator-Fiscal?&nbsp; You never
thought of that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; No, man.&nbsp;
Why?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; Aha!&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s the riddle.&nbsp; Will you guess?&nbsp; No? . . . I
thought I knew the man.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; What d&rsquo;ye
say?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; I thought I knew
him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Wha was&rsquo;t?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; Ah, there you go
beyond me.&nbsp; That I cannot tell.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; As God sees ye,
laddie, are ye speaking truth?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; Well . . . of
course!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; The haill truth?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; All of it.&nbsp; Why
not?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Man, I&rsquo;d a kind
o&rsquo; gliff.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; Why, what were you
afraid of?&nbsp; Had you a suspicion?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Me?&nbsp; Me a
suspicion?&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;re daft, sir; and me the Crown
offeecial! . . . Eh man, I&rsquo;m a&rsquo; shakin&rsquo; . . .
And sae ye thocht ye kennt him?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; I did that.&nbsp; And
what&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;ve sat every night in case of his
return.&nbsp; I promise you, Procurator, he shall not slip me
twice.&nbsp; Meanwhile I&rsquo;m worried and put out.&nbsp; You
understand how such a fancy will upset a man.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
uneasy with my friends and on bad terms with my own
conscience.&nbsp; I keep watching, spying, comparing, putting two
and two together, hunting for resemblances until my head goes
round.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like a puzzle in a dream.&nbsp; Only
yesterday I thought I had him.&nbsp; And who d&rsquo;you think it
was?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Wha?&nbsp; Wha
was&rsquo;t?&nbsp; Speak, Mr. Leslie, speak.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m an
auld man; dinna forget that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; I name no
names.&nbsp; It would be unjust to him; and, upon my word, it was
so silly it would be unfair to me.&nbsp; However, here I sit,
night after night.&nbsp; I mean him to come back; come back he
shall; and I&rsquo;ll tell you who he was next morning.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lawson</span>.&nbsp; Let sleeping dogs
lie, Mr. Leslie; ye dinna ken what ye micht see.&nbsp; And then,
leave him alane, he&rsquo;ll come nae mair.&nbsp; And sitting up
a&rsquo; nicht . . . it&rsquo;s a <i>factum imprestabile</i>, as
we say: a thing impossible to man.&nbsp; Gang ye to your bed,
like a guid laddie, and sleep lang and soundly, and bonnie,
bonnie dreams to ye!&nbsp; (<i>Without</i>.)&nbsp; Let sleeping
dogs lie, and gang ye to your bed.</p>
<h5>SCENE III</h5>
<p style="text-align: center"><span

<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span> (<i>calling</i>).&nbsp; In
good time, never fear!&nbsp; (<i>He carefully bolts and chains
the door</i>.)&nbsp; The old gentleman seems upset.&nbsp; What
for, I wonder?&nbsp; Has he had a masked visitor?&nbsp; Why
not?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the fashion.&nbsp; Out with the
lights.&nbsp; (<i>Blows out the candles</i>.&nbsp; <i>The stage
is only lighted by the moon through the window</i>.)&nbsp; He is
sure to come one night or other.&nbsp; He must come.&nbsp; Right
or wrong, I feel it in the air.&nbsp; Man, but I know you, I know
you somewhere.&nbsp; That trick of the shoulders, the hang of the
clothes&mdash;whose are they?&nbsp; Where have I seen them?&nbsp;
And then, that single look of the eye, that one glance about the
room as the window opened . . . it is almost friendly; I have
caught it over the glass&rsquo;s rim!&nbsp; If it should be . . .
his?&nbsp; No, his it is not.</p>

there&rsquo;s a long night before you and me, watchmen.&nbsp;
Heavens, what a trade!&nbsp; But it will be something to laugh
over with Mary and . . . with him?&nbsp; Damn it, the delusion is
too strong for me.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a thing to be ashamed
of.&nbsp; &lsquo;We Brodies&rsquo;: how she says it!&nbsp;
&lsquo;We Brodies and our Deacon&rsquo;: what a pride she takes
in it, and how good it sounds to me!&nbsp; &lsquo;Deacon of his
craft, sir, Deacon of the . . .!&nbsp; (<span

<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; To say?&nbsp; Not
much&mdash;God help me&mdash;and commonplace, commonplace like
sin.&nbsp; I was honest once; I made a false step; I

you make excuses?&nbsp; You&mdash;a man found out, shamed, a

Don&rsquo;t weep, my good old friend; I was lost long since;

bound the millstone round my neck; [it is irrevocable now,] and
you must all suffer . . . all suffer for me! . . . [for this
suffering remnant of what was once a man].&nbsp; O God, that I
can have fallen to stand here as I do now.&nbsp; My friend lying
to save me from the gallows; my second father weeping tears of
blood for my disgrace!&nbsp; And all for what?&nbsp; By
what?&nbsp; Because I had an open hand, because I was a selfish
dog, because I loved this woman.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span>.&nbsp; O Wullie, and she

you must fly.</p>

fly; and O, as God sees me, I will strive to make a new and a
better life, and to be worthy of your friendship, and of your

myself, O how unworthy even of you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; Why not to-night?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; It cannot be

<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span> (<i>to</i> <span

you get carried away by the fire of old Rome.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s

pitcher, the Deakin, will make a better job of it than he did
last night.&nbsp; If he don&rsquo;t, I shall retire from the

last?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Smith</span>.&nbsp; This morning; and he
looked as if he was rehearsing for his own epitaph.&nbsp; I never
see such a change in a man.&nbsp; I gave him the office for
to-night; and was he grateful?&nbsp; Did he weep upon my faithful
bosom?&nbsp; No; he smiled upon me like a portrait of the dear
departed.&nbsp; I see his &rsquo;art was far away; and it broke
my own to look at him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moore</span>.&nbsp; Muck!&nbsp; Wot I ses
is, if a cove&rsquo;s got that much of the nob about him,
wot&rsquo;s the good of his working single-handed?&nbsp;

<span class="smcap">Leslie</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; O Walter, Walter!&nbsp;
What does it mean?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; You have been a brave
girl all your life, Mary; you must lean on me . . . you must
trust in me . . . and be a brave girl till the end.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Who is she?&nbsp; What
does she want with <i>him</i>?&nbsp; And he . . . where is
he?&nbsp; Do you know that my father is dead, and the Deacon not
here?&nbsp; Where has he gone?&nbsp; He may be dead, too.&nbsp;
Father, brother . . . O God, it is more than I can bear!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; Mary, my dear, dear
girl . . . when will you be my wife?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; O, do not speak . . .
not speak . . . of it to-night.&nbsp; Not to-night!&nbsp; O not
to-night!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; I know, I know dear
heart!&nbsp; And do you think that I whom you have chosen, I
whose whole life is in your love&mdash;do you think that I would
press you now if there were not good cause?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Good cause!&nbsp;
Something has happened.&nbsp; Something has happened . . . to
him!&nbsp; Walter . . . !&nbsp; Is he . . . dead?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; There are worse
things in the world than death.&nbsp; There is O . . . Mary, he
is your brother!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Dishonour!
. . . The Deacon! . . . My God!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; My wife, my wife!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; No, no!&nbsp; Keep away
from me.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t touch me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not fit . .
. not fit to be near you.&nbsp; What has he done?&nbsp; I am his
sister.&nbsp; Tell me the worst.&nbsp; Tell me the worst at
once.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; That, if God wills,
dear, that you shall never know.&nbsp; Whatever it be, think that
I knew it all, and only loved you better; think that your true
husband is with you, and you are not to bear it alone.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; My husband? . . .
Never.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; Mary . . . !</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; You forget, you forget
what I am.&nbsp; I am his sister.&nbsp; I owe him a lifetime of
happiness and love; I owe him even you.&nbsp; And whatever his
fault, however ruinous his disgrace, he is my brother&mdash;my
own brother&mdash;and my place is still with him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; Your place is with
me&mdash;is with your husband.&nbsp; With me, with me; and for
his sake most of all.&nbsp; What can you do for him alone? how
can you help him alone?&nbsp; It wrings my heart to think how
little.&nbsp; But together is different.&nbsp; Together . . . I
join my strength, my will, my courage to your own, and together
we may save him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; All that is over.&nbsp;
Once I was blessed among women.&nbsp; I was my father&rsquo;s
daughter, my brother loved me, I lived to be your wife.&nbsp; Now
. . . !&nbsp; My father is dead, my brother is shamed; and you .
. . O how could I face the world, how could I endure myself, if I
preferred my happiness to your honour?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; What is my honour but
your happiness?&nbsp; In what else does it consist?&nbsp; Is it
in denying me my heart? is it in visiting another&rsquo;s sin
upon the innocent?&nbsp; Could I do that, and be my
mother&rsquo;s son?&nbsp; Could I do that, and bear my
father&rsquo;s name?&nbsp; Could I do that, and have ever been
found worthy of you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; It is my duty . . . my
duty.&nbsp; Why will you make it so hard for me?&nbsp; So hard,
Walter so hard!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; Do I pursue you only
for your good fortune, your beauty, the credit of your friends,
your family&rsquo;s good name?&nbsp; That were not love, and I
love you.&nbsp; I love you, dearest, I love you.&nbsp; Friend,
father, brother, husband . . . I must be all these to you.&nbsp;
I am a man who can love well.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Silence . . . in
pity!&nbsp; I cannot . . . O, I cannot bear it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; And say it was I who
had fallen.&nbsp; Say I had played my neck and lost it . . . that
I were pushed by the law to the last limits of ignominy and
despair.&nbsp; Whose love would sanctify my jail to me? whose
pity would shine upon me in the dock? whose prayers would
accompany me to the gallows?&nbsp; Whose but yours?&nbsp; Yours!
. . . And you would entreat me&mdash;me!&mdash;to do what you
shrink from even in thought, what you would die ere you attempted
in deed!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Walter . . . on my
knees . . . no more, no more!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; My wife! my
wife!&nbsp; Here on my heart!&nbsp; It is I that must kneel . . .
I that must kneel to you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Dearest! . . .
Husband!&nbsp; You forgive him?&nbsp; O, you forgive him?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.&nbsp; He is my brother
now.&nbsp; Let me take you to our father.&nbsp; Come.</p>

your neck, your neck you fought for.&nbsp; They were closing
hell-doors upon me, swift as the wind, when I slipped through and
shot for heaven!&nbsp; Saved!&nbsp; The dog that sold me, I
settled him; and the other dogs are staunch.&nbsp; Man, but your
alibi will stand!&nbsp; Is the window fast?&nbsp; The neighbours
must not see the Deacon, the poor, sick Deacon, up and stirring
at this time o&rsquo; night.&nbsp; Ay, the good old room in the
good, cozy old house . . . and the rat a dead rat, and all
saved.&nbsp; (<i>He lights the candles</i>.)&nbsp; Your hand
shakes, sir?&nbsp; Fie!&nbsp; And you saved, and you snug and
sick in your bed, and it but a dead rat after all?&nbsp; (<i>He
takes off his hanger and lays it on the table</i>.)&nbsp; Ay, it
was a near touch.&nbsp; Will it come to the dock?&nbsp; If it
does!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve a tongue, and you&rsquo;ve a head, and
you&rsquo;ve an alibi; and your alibi will stand.&nbsp; (<i>He
takes off his coat</i>, <i>takes out the dagger</i>, <i>and with
a gesture of striking</i>)&nbsp; Home!&nbsp; He fell without a

table</i>.)&nbsp; Your alibi . . . ah Deacon, that&rsquo;s your
life! . . . your alibi, your alibi.&nbsp; (<i>He takes up a

<h5>SCENE V</h5>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>,
<span class="smcap">Mary</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Did you open the
door?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; I did.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; You . . . you opened
the door?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; I did open it</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Were you . . .
alone?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; I was not.&nbsp; The
servant was with me; and the doctor.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; O . . . the servant .
. . and the doctor.&nbsp; Very true.&nbsp; Then it&rsquo;s all
over the town by now.&nbsp; The servant and the doctor.&nbsp; The
doctor?&nbsp; What doctor?&nbsp; Why the doctor?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; My father is
dead.&nbsp; O Will, where have you been?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Your father is
dead.&nbsp; O yes!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s dead, is he?&nbsp;
Dead.&nbsp; Quite right.&nbsp; Quite right . . . How did you open
the door?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s strange.&nbsp; I bolted it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; We could not help it,
Will, now could we?&nbsp; The doctor forced it.&nbsp; He had to,
had he not?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; The doctor forced
it?&nbsp; The doctor?&nbsp; Was he here?&nbsp; He forced
it?&nbsp; He?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; We did it for the best;
it was I who did it . . . I, your own sister.&nbsp; And O Will,
my Willie, where have you been?&nbsp; You have not been in any
harm, any danger?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Danger?&nbsp; O my
young lady, you have taken care of that.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not
danger now, it&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; Death?&nbsp; Ah! Death!&nbsp;
Death! Death!&nbsp; (<i>Clutching the table</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Then</i>, <i>recovering as from a dream</i>.)&nbsp;
Death?&nbsp; Did you say my father was dead?&nbsp; My
father?&nbsp; O my God, my poor old father!&nbsp; Is he dead,
Mary?&nbsp; Have I lost him? is he gone?&nbsp; O, Mary dear, and
to think of where his son was!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Dearest, he is in
heaven.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Did he suffer?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; He died like a
child.&nbsp; Your name . . . it was his last.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; My name?&nbsp;
Mine?&nbsp; O Mary, if he had known!&nbsp; He knows now.&nbsp; He
knows; he sees us now . . . sees me!&nbsp; Ay, and sees you, left
how lonely!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Not so, dear; not while
you live.&nbsp; Wherever you are, I shall not be alone, so you
live.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; While I live?&nbsp;
I?&nbsp; The old house is ruined, and the old master dead, and
I!&nbsp; . . .&nbsp; O Mary, try and believe I did not mean that
it should come to this; try and believe that I was only weak at
first.&nbsp; At first?&nbsp; And now!&nbsp; The good old man
dead, the kind sister ruined, the innocent boy fallen, fallen . .
. !&nbsp; You will be quite alone; all your old friends, all the
old faces, gone into darkness.&nbsp; The night (<i>with a
gesture</i>) . . . it waits for me.&nbsp; You will be quite
alone.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; The night!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Mary, you must
hear.&nbsp; How am I to tell her, and the old man just
dead!&nbsp; Mary, I was the boy you knew; I loved pleasure, I was
weak; I have fallen . . . low . . . lower than you think.&nbsp; A
beginning is so small a thing!&nbsp; I never dreamed it would
come to this . . . this hideous last night.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Willie, you must tell
me, dear.&nbsp; I must have the truth . . . the kind truth . . .
at once . . . in pity.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Crime.&nbsp; I have
fallen.&nbsp; Crime.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Crime?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t shrink
from me.&nbsp; Miserable dog that I am, selfish hound that has
dragged you to this misery . . . you and all that loved him . . .
think only of my torments, think only of my penitence,
don&rsquo;t shrink from me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; I do not care to hear,
I do not wish, I do not mind; you are my brother.&nbsp; What do I
care?&nbsp; How can I help you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Help? help
<i>me</i>?&nbsp; You would not speak of it, not wish it, if you
knew.&nbsp; My kind good sister, my little playmate, my sweet
friend! was I ever unkind to you till yesterday?&nbsp; Not openly
unkind? you&rsquo;ll say that when I am gone.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; If you have done wrong,
what do I care?&nbsp; If you have failed, does it change my
twenty years of love and worship?&nbsp; Never!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Yet I must make her
understand . . . !</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; I am your true sister,
dear.&nbsp; I cannot fail, I will never leave you, I will never
blame you.&nbsp; Come!&nbsp; (<i>Goes to embrace</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span> (<i>recoiling</i>).&nbsp;
No, don&rsquo;t touch me, not a finger, not that, anything but
that!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Willie, Willie!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span> (<i>taking the bloody dagger
from the table</i>).&nbsp; See, do you understand that?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; What, what is
it!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Blood.&nbsp; I have
killed a man.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; You? . . .</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; I am a murderer; I
was a thief before.&nbsp; Your brother . . . the old man&rsquo;s
only son!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Walter, Walter, come to
me!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brodie</span>.&nbsp; Now you see that I
must die; now you see that I stand upon the grave&rsquo;s edge,
all my lost life behind me, like a horror to think upon, like a
frenzy, like a dream that is past.&nbsp; And you, you are
alone.&nbsp; Father, brother, they are gone from you; one to
heaven, one . . . !</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>.&nbsp; Hush, dear, hush!&nbsp;
Kneel, pray; it is not too late to repent.&nbsp; Think of our
father dear; repent.&nbsp; (<i>She weeps</i>, <i>straining to his
bosom</i>.)&nbsp; O Willie, my darling boy, repent and join
us.</p>

<h3>PROLOGUE</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Spoken by</i> <span
class="smcap">Mr. Tree</span> <i>in the character of Beau
Austin</i></p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;To all and singular,&rsquo; as Dryden
says,<br />
We bring a fancy of those Georgian days,<br />
Whose style still breathed a faint and fine perfume<br />
Of old-world courtliness and old-world bloom:<br />
When speech was elegant and talk was fit<br />
For slang had not been canonised as wit;<br />
When manners reigned, when breeding had the wall,<br />
And Women&mdash;yes!&mdash;were ladies first of all;<br />
When Grace was conscious of its gracefulness,<br />
And man&mdash;though Man!&mdash;was not ashamed to dress.<br />
A brave formality, a measured ease,<br />
Were his&mdash;and her&rsquo;s&mdash;whose effort was to
please.<br />
And to excel in pleasing was to reign<br />
And, if you sighed, never to sigh in vain.</p>
<p class="poetry">But then, as now&mdash;it may be, something
more&mdash;<br />
Woman and man were human to the core.<br />
The hearts that throbbed behind that quaint attire<br />
Burned with a plenitude of essential fire.<br />
They too could risk, they also could rebel,<br />
They could love wisely&mdash;they could love too well.<br />
In that great duel of Sex, that ancient strife<br />
Which is the very central fact of life,<br />
They could&mdash;and did&mdash;engage it breath for breath,<br />
They could&mdash;and did&mdash;get wounded unto death.<br />
As at all times since time for us began<br />
Woman was truly woman, man was man,<br />
And joy and sorrow were as much at home<br />
In trifling Tunbridge as in mighty Rome.</p>
<p class="poetry">Dead&mdash;dead and done with!&nbsp; Swift from
shine to shade<br />
The roaring generations flit and fade.<br />
To this one, fading, flitting, like the rest,<br />
We come to proffer&mdash;be it worst or best&mdash;<br />
A sketch, a shadow, of one brave old time;<br />
A hint of what it might have held sublime;<br />
A dream, an idyll, call it what you will,<br />
Of man still Man, and woman&mdash;Woman still!</p>
<h3>ACT I.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Musical Induction</span>: &lsquo;<i>Lascia
ch&rsquo;io pianga</i>&rsquo; (<i>Rinaldo</i>).</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Handel</span>.</p>
<p><i>The Stage represents Miss Foster&rsquo;s apartments at the
Wells</i>.&nbsp; <i>Doors</i>, <i>L. and C.</i>; <i>a window</i>,
<i>L. C.</i>, <i>looking on the street</i>; <i>a table R.</i>,
<i>laid for breakfast</i>.</p>
<h4>SCENE I</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>;
<i>to her</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span> (<i>out of
window</i>).&nbsp; Mr. Menteith!&nbsp; Mr. Menteith!&nbsp; Mr.
Menteith!&mdash;Drat his old head!&nbsp; Will nothing make him
hear?&mdash;Mr. Menteith!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>
(<i>entering</i>).&nbsp; Barbara! this is incredible: after all
my lessons, to be leaning from the window, and calling (for
unless my ears deceived me, you were positively calling!) into
the street.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; Well, madam, just
wait until you hear who it was.&nbsp; I declare it was much more
for Miss Dorothy and yourself than for me; and if it was a little
countrified, I had a good excuse.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; Nonsense,
child!&nbsp; At least, who was it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; Miss Evelina, I was
sure you would ask.&nbsp; Well, what do you think?&nbsp; I was
looking out of window at the barber&rsquo;s opposite&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; Of which I
entirely disapprove&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; And first there came
out two of the most beautiful&mdash;the Royal livery, madam!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; Of course, of
course: the Duke of York arrived last night.&nbsp; I trust you
did not hail the Duke&rsquo;s footmen?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; O no, madam, it was
after they were gone.&nbsp; Then, who should come out&mdash;but
you&rsquo;ll never guess!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; I shall
certainly not try.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; Mr. Menteith
himself!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; Why, child, I
never heard of him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; O madam, not the
Beau&rsquo;s own gentleman?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; Mr.
Austin&rsquo;s servant.&nbsp; No?&nbsp; Is it possible?&nbsp; By
that, George Austin must be here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; No doubt of that,
madam; they&rsquo;re never far apart.&nbsp; He came out feeling
his chin, madam, so; and a packet of letters under his arm, so;
and he had the Beau&rsquo;s own walk to that degree you
couldn&rsquo;t tell his back from his master&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; My dear Barbara,
you too frequently forget yourself.&nbsp; A young woman in your
position must beware of levity.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; Madam, I know it;
but la, what are you to make of me?&nbsp; Look at the time and
trouble dear Miss Dorothy was always taking&mdash;she that
trained up everybody&mdash;and see what&rsquo;s come of it:
Barbara Ridley I was, and Barbara Ridley I am; and I don&rsquo;t
do with fashionable ways&mdash;I can&rsquo;t do with them; and
indeed, Miss Evelina, I do sometimes wish we were all back again
on Edenside, and Mr. Anthony a boy again, and dear Miss Dorothy
her old self, galloping the bay mare along the moor, and taking
care of all of us as if she was our mother, bless her heart!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; Miss Dorothy
herself, child?&nbsp; Well, now you mention it, Tunbridge of late
has scarcely seemed to suit her constitution.&nbsp; She falls
away, has not a word to throw at a dog, and is ridiculously
pale.&nbsp; Well, now Mr. Austin has returned, after six months
of infidelity to the dear Wells, we shall all, I hope, be
brightened up.&nbsp; Has the mail come?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; That it has, madam,
and the sight of Mr. Menteith put it clean out of my head.&nbsp;
(<i>With letters</i>.)&nbsp; Four for you, Miss Evelina, two for
me, and only one for Miss Dorothy.&nbsp; Miss Dorothy seems quite
neglected, does she not?&nbsp; Six months ago, it was a different
story.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; Well, and
that&rsquo;s true, Barbara, and I had not remarked it.&nbsp; I
must take her seriously to task.&nbsp; No young lady in her
position should neglect her correspondence.&nbsp; (<i>Opening a
letter</i>.)&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s from that dear ridiculous boy,
the Cornet, announcing his arrival for to-day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; O madam, will he
come in his red coat?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; I could not
conceive him missing such a chance.&nbsp; Youth, child, is always
vain, and Mr. Anthony is unusually young.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; La, madam, he
can&rsquo;t help that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; My child, I am
not so sure.&nbsp; Mr. Anthony is a great concern to me.&nbsp; He
was orphaned, to be sure, at ten years old; and ever since he has
been only as it were his sister&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; Dorothy did
everything for him: more indeed than I thought quite ladylike,
but I suppose I begin to be old-fashioned.&nbsp; See how she
worked and slaved&mdash;yes, slaved!&mdash;for him: teaching him
herself, with what pains and patience she only could reveal, and
learning that she might be able; and see what he is now: a
gentleman, of course, but, to be frank, a very commonplace one:
not what I had hoped of Dorothy&rsquo;s brother; not what I had
dreamed of the heir of two families&mdash;Musgrave and Foster,
child!&nbsp; Well, he may now meet Mr. Austin.&nbsp; He requires
a Mr. Austin to embellish and correct his manners.&nbsp;
(<i>Opening another letter</i>.)&nbsp; Why, Barbara, Mr. John
Scrope and Miss Kate Dacre are to be married!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; La, madam, how
nice!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; They are: As
I&rsquo;m a sinful woman.&nbsp; And when will you be married,
Barbara? and when dear Dorothy?&nbsp; I hate to see old maids
a-making.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; La, Miss Evelina,
there&rsquo;s no harm in an old maid.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; You speak like a
fool, child: sour grapes are all very well but it&rsquo;s a
woman&rsquo;s business to be married.&nbsp; As for Dorothy, she
is five-and-twenty, and she breaks my heart.&nbsp; Such a match,
too!&nbsp; Ten thousand to her fortune, the best blood in the
north, a most advantageous person, all the graces, the finest
sensibility, excellent judgment, the Foster walk; and all these
to go positively a-begging!&nbsp; The men seem stricken with
blindness.&nbsp; Why, child, when I came out (and I was the dear
girl&rsquo;s image!) I had more swains at my feet in a fortnight
than our Dorothy in&mdash;O, I cannot fathom it: it must be the
girl&rsquo;s own fault.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; Why, madam, I did
think it was a case with Mr. Austin.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; With Mr. Austin?
why, how very rustic!&nbsp; The attentions of a gentleman like
Mr. Austin, child, are not supposed to lead to matrimony.&nbsp;
He is a feature of society: an ornament: a personage: a private
gentleman by birth, but a kind of king by habit and
reputation.&nbsp; What woman could he marry?&nbsp; Those to whom
he might properly aspire are all too far below him.&nbsp; I have
known George Austin too long, child, and I understand that the
very greatness of his success condemns him to remain
unmarried.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; Sure, madam, that
must be tiresome for him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; Some day, child,
you will know better than to think so.&nbsp; George Austin, as I
conceive him, and as he is regarded by the world, is one of the
triumphs of the other sex.&nbsp; I walked my first minuet with
him: I wouldn&rsquo;t tell you the year, child, for worlds; but
it was soon after his famous rencounter with Colonel
Villiers.&nbsp; He had killed his man, he wore pink and silver,
was most elegantly pale, and the most ravishing creature!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; Well, madam, I
believe that: he is the most beautiful gentleman still.</p>
<h4>SCENE II</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>To these</i>, <span
class="smcap">Dorothy</span>, <i>L</i></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span> (<i>entering</i>).&nbsp;
Good-morning, aunt!&nbsp; Is there anything for me?&nbsp; (<i>She
goes eagerly to table</i>, <i>and looks at letters</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; Good-morrow,
niece.&nbsp; Breakfast, Barbara.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span> (<i>with letter
unopened</i>).&nbsp; Nothing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; And what do you
call that, my dear?&nbsp; (<i>Sitting</i>.)&nbsp; Is John Fenwick
nobody?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span> (<i>looking at
letter</i>.)&nbsp; From John?&nbsp; O yes, so it is.&nbsp;
(<i>Lays down letter unopened</i>, <i>and sits to breakfast</i>,
<span class="smcap">Barbara</span> <i>waiting</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span> (<i>to</i> <span
class="smcap">Barbara</span>, <i>with plate</i>).&nbsp; Thanks,
child; now you may give me some tea.&nbsp; Dolly, I must insist
on your eating a good breakfast: I cannot away with your pale
cheeks and that Patience-on-a Monument kind of look.&nbsp;
(Toast, Barbara.)&nbsp; At Edenside you ate and drank and looked
like Hebe.&nbsp; What have you done with your appetite?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know,
aunt, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; Then consider,
please, and recover it as soon as you can: to a young lady in
your position a good appetite is an attraction&mdash;almost a
virtue.&nbsp; Do you know that your brother arrives this
morning?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; Dear Anthony!&nbsp;
Where is his letter, Aunt Evelina?&nbsp; I am pleased that he
should leave London and its perils, if only for a day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; My dear, there
are moments when you positively amaze.&nbsp; (Barbara, some
<i>p&acirc;t&eacute;</i>, if you please!)&nbsp; I beg you not to
be a prude.&nbsp; All women, of course, are virtuous; but a prude
is something I regard with abhorrence.&nbsp; The Cornet is seeing
life, which is exactly what he wanted.&nbsp; You brought him up
surprisingly well; I have always admired you for it; but let us
admit&mdash;as women of the world, my dear&mdash;it was no
upbringing for a man.&nbsp; You and that fine solemn fellow, John
Fenwick, led a life that was positively no better than the Middle
Ages; and between the two of you, poor Anthony (who, I am sure,
was a most passive creature!) was so packed with principle and
admonition that I vow and declare he reminded me of Issachar
stooping between his two burdens.&nbsp; It was high time for him
to be done with your apron-string, my dear: he has all his wild
oats to sow; and that is an occupation which it is unwise to
defer too long.&nbsp; By the bye, have you heard the news?&nbsp;
The Duke of York has done us a service for which I was
unprepared.&nbsp; (More tea, Barbara!)&nbsp; George Austin,
bringing the prince in his train, is with us once more.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; I knew he was
coming.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; You knew, child?
and did not tell?&nbsp; You are a public criminal.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; I did not think it
mattered, Aunt Evelina.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; O do not
make-believe.&nbsp; I am in love with him myself, and have been
any time since Nelson and the Nile.&nbsp; As for you, Dolly,
since he went away six months ago, you have been positively in
the megrims.&nbsp; I shall date your loss of appetite from George
Austin&rsquo;s vanishing.&nbsp; No, my dear, our family require
entertainment: we must have wit about us, and beauty, and the
<i>bel air</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; Well, Miss Dorothy,
perhaps it&rsquo;s out of my place: but I do hope Mr. Austin will
come: I should love to have him see my necklace on.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; Necklace? what
necklace?&nbsp; Did he give you a necklace?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; Yes, indeed, Miss,
that he did: the very same day he drove you in his curricle to
Penshurst.&nbsp; You remember, Miss, I couldn&rsquo;t go.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; I remember.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; And so do
I.&nbsp; I had a touch of . . . Foster in the blood: the family
gout, dears! . . .&nbsp; And you, you ungrateful nymph, had him a
whole day to yourself, and not a word to tell me when you
returned.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; I remember.&nbsp;
(<i>Rising</i>.)&nbsp; Is that the necklace, Barbara?&nbsp; It
does not suit you.&nbsp; Give it me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; La, Miss Dorothy, I
wouldn&rsquo;t for the world.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; Come, give it
me.&nbsp; I want it.&nbsp; Thank you: you shall have my birthday
pearls instead.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; Why, Dolly, I
believe you&rsquo;re jealous of the maid.&nbsp; Foster, Foster:
always a Foster trick to wear the willow in anger.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; I do not think,
madam, that I am of a jealous habit.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; O, the personage
is your excuse!&nbsp; And I can tell you, child, that when George
Austin was playing Florizel to the Duchess&rsquo;s Perdita, all
the maids in England fell a prey to green-eyed melancholy.&nbsp;
It was the <i>ton</i>, you see: not to pine for that Sylvander
was to resign from good society.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; Aunt Evelina, stop;
I cannot endure to hear you.&nbsp; What is he after all but just
Beau Austin?&nbsp; What has he done&mdash;with half a century of
good health, what has he done that is either memorable or
worthy?&nbsp; Diced and danced and set fashions; vanquished in a
drawing-room, fought for a word; what else?&nbsp; As if these
were the meaning of life!&nbsp; Do not make me think so poorly of
all of us women.&nbsp; Sure, we can rise to admire a better kind
of man than Mr. Austin.&nbsp; We are not all to be snared with
the eye, dear aunt; and those that are&mdash;O!&nbsp; I know not
whether I more hate or pity them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; You will give me
leave, my niece: such talk is neither becoming in a young lady
nor creditable to your understanding.&nbsp; The world was made a
great while before Miss Dorothy Musgrave; and you will do much
better to ripen your opinions, and in the meantime read your
letter, which I perceive you have not opened.&nbsp; (<span
class="smcap">Dorothy</span> <i>opens and reads
letter</i>.)&nbsp; Barbara, child, you should not listen at
table.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; Sure, madam, I hope
I know my place.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; Then do not do
it again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; Poor John Fenwick!
he coming here!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; Well, and why
not?&nbsp; Dorothy, my darling child, you give me pain.&nbsp; You
never had but one chance, let me tell you pointedly: and that was
John Fenwick.&nbsp; If I were you, I would not let my vanity so
blind me.&nbsp; This is not the way to marry.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; Dear aunt, I shall
never marry.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; A
fiddlestick&rsquo;s end! every one must marry.&nbsp;
(<i>Rising</i>.)&nbsp; Are you for the Pantiles?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; Not to-day,
dear,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; Well, well! have
your wish, Dolorosa.&nbsp; Barbara, attend and dress me.</p>
<h4>SCENE III</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Dorothy</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; How she tortures me,
poor aunt, my poor blind aunt; and I&mdash;I could break her
heart with a word.&nbsp; That she should see nothing, know
nothing&mdash;there&rsquo;s where it kills.&nbsp; O, it is more
than I can bear . . . and yet, how much less than I
deserve!&nbsp; Mad girl, of what do I complain? that this dear
innocent woman still believes me good, still pierces me to the
soul with trustfulness.&nbsp; Alas, and were it otherwise, were
her dear eyes opened to the truth, what were left me but
death?&mdash;He, too&mdash;she must still be praising him, and
every word is a lash upon my conscience.&nbsp; If I could die of
my secret: if I could cease&mdash;but one moment cease&mdash;this
living lie; if I could sleep and forget and be at
rest!&mdash;Poor John! (<i>reading the letter</i>) he at least is
guiltless; and yet for my fault he too must suffer, he too must
bear part in my shame.&nbsp; Poor John Fenwick!&nbsp; Has he come
back with the old story: with what might have been, perhaps, had
we stayed by Edenside?&nbsp; Eden? yes, my Eden, from which I
fell.&nbsp; O my old north country, my old river&mdash;the river
of my innocence, the old country of my hopes&mdash;how could I
endure to look on you now?&nbsp; And how to meet
John?&mdash;John, with the old love on his lips, the old, honest,
innocent, faithful heart!&nbsp; There was a Dorothy once who was
not unfit to ride with him, her heart as light as his, her life
as clear as the bright rivers we forded; he called her his Diana,
he crowned her so with rowan.&nbsp; Where is that Dorothy now?
that Diana? she that was everything to John?&nbsp; For O, I did
him good; I know I did him good; I will still believe I did him
good: I made him honest and kind and a true man; alas, and could
not guide myself!&nbsp; And now, how will he despise me!&nbsp;
For he shall know; if I die, he shall know all; I could not live,
and not be true with him.&nbsp; (<i>She takes out the necklace
and looks at it</i>.)&nbsp; That he should have bought me from my
maid!&nbsp; George, George, that you should have stooped to
this!&nbsp; Basely as you have used me, this is the basest.&nbsp;
Perish the witness!&nbsp; (<i>She treads the trinket under
foot</i>.)&nbsp; Break, break like my heart, break like my hopes,
perish like my good name!</p>
<h4>SCENE IV</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>To her</i>, <span
class="smcap">Fenwick</span>, <i>C.</i></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span> (<i>after a
pause</i>).&nbsp; Is this how you receive me, Dorothy?&nbsp; Am I
not welcome?&mdash;Shall I go then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span> (<i>running to him</i>,
<i>with hands outstretched</i>).&nbsp; O no, John, not for
me.&nbsp; (<i>Turning</i>, <i>and pointing to the
necklace</i>.)&nbsp; But you find me changed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span> (<i>with a movement towards
the necklace</i>).&nbsp; This?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; No, no, let it
lie.&nbsp; That is a trinket&mdash;broken.&nbsp; But the old
Dorothy is dead.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; Dead, dear?&nbsp;
Not to me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; Dead to
you&mdash;dead to all men.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; Dorothy, I loved you
as a boy.&nbsp; There is not a meadow on Edenside but is dear to
me for your sake, not a cottage but recalls your goodness, not a
rock nor a tree but brings back something of the best and
brightest youth man ever had.&nbsp; You were my teacher and my
queen; I walked with you, I talked with you, I rode with you; I
lived in your shadow; I saw with your eyes.&nbsp; You will never
know, dear Dorothy, what you were to the dull boy you bore with;
you will never know with what romance you filled my life, with
what devotion, with what tenderness and honour.&nbsp; At night I
lay awake and worshipped you; in my dreams I saw you, and you
loved me; and you remember, when we told each other
stories&mdash;you have not forgotten, dearest&mdash;that Princess
Hawthorn that was still the heroine of mine: who was she?&nbsp; I
was not bold enough to tell, but she was you!&nbsp; You, my
virgin huntress, my Diana, my queen.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; O silence,
silence&mdash;pity!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; No, dear; neither
for your sake nor mine will I be silenced.&nbsp; I have begun; I
must go on and finish, and put fortune to the touch.&nbsp; It was
from you I learned honour, duty, piety, and love.&nbsp; I am as
you made me, and I exist but to reverence and serve you.&nbsp;
Why else have I come here, the length of England, my heart
burning higher every mile, my very horse a clog to me? why, but
to ask you for my wife?&nbsp; Dorothy, you will not deny me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; You have not asked
me about this broken trinket?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; Why should I
ask?&nbsp; I love you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; Yet I must tell
you.&nbsp; Sit down.&nbsp; (<i>She picks up the necklace</i>,
<i>and stands looking at it</i>.&nbsp; <i>Then</i>, <i>breaking
down</i>.)&nbsp; O John, John, it&rsquo;s long since I left
home.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; Too long, dear
love.&nbsp; The very trees will welcome you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; Ay, John, but I no
longer love you.&nbsp; The old Dorothy is dead, God pardon
her!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; Dorothy, who is the
man?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; O poor
Dorothy!&nbsp; O poor dead Dorothy!&nbsp; John, you found me
breaking this: me, your Diana of the Fells, the Diana of your old
romance by Edenside.&nbsp; Diana&mdash;O what a name for
me!&nbsp; Do you see this trinket?&nbsp; It is a chapter in my
life.&nbsp; A chapter, do I say? my whole life, for there is none
to follow.&nbsp; John, you must bear with me, you must help
me.&nbsp; I have that to tell&mdash;there is a secret&mdash;I
have a secret, John&mdash;O, for God&rsquo;s sake,
understand.&nbsp; That Diana you revered&mdash;O John, John, you
must never speak of love to me again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; What do you
say?&nbsp; How dare you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; John, it is the
truth.&nbsp; Your Diana, even she, she whom you so believed in,
she who so believed in herself, came out into the world only to
be broken.&nbsp; I met, here at the Wells, a man&mdash;why should
I tell you his name?&nbsp; I met him, and I loved him.&nbsp; My
heart was all his own; yet he was not content with that: he must
intrigue to catch me, he must bribe my maid with this.&nbsp;
(<i>Throws the necklace on the table</i>.)&nbsp; Did he love
me?&nbsp; Well, John, he said he did; and be it so!&nbsp; He
loved, he betrayed, and he has left me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; Betrayed?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; Ay, even so; I was
betrayed.&nbsp; The fault was mine that I forgot our innocent
youth, and your honest love.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; Dorothy, O
Dorothy!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; Yours is the pain;
but, O John, think it is for your good.&nbsp; Think in England
how many true maids may be waiting for your love, haw many that
can bring you a whole heart, and be a noble mother to your
children, while your poor Diana, at the first touch, has proved
all frailty.&nbsp; Go, go and be happy, and let me be
patient.&nbsp; I have sinned.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; By God, I&rsquo;ll
have his blood.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; Stop!&nbsp; I love
him.&nbsp; (<i>Between</i> <span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>
<i>and door</i>, <i>C.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; What do I
care?&nbsp; I loved you too.&nbsp; Little he thought of that,
little either of you thought of that.&nbsp; His
blood&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have his blood!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; You shall never know
his name.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; Know it?&nbsp; Do
you think I cannot guess?&nbsp; Do you think I had not heard he
followed you.&nbsp; Do you think I had not suffered&mdash;O
suffered!&nbsp; George Austin is the man.&nbsp; Dear shall he pay
it!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span> (<i>at his feet</i>).&nbsp;
Pity me; spare me, spare your Dorothy!&nbsp; I love
him&mdash;love him&mdash;love him!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; Dorothy, you have
robbed me of my happiness, and now you would rob me of my
revenge.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; I know it; and shall
I ask, and you not grant?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span> (<i>raising her</i>).&nbsp;
No, Dorothy, you shall ask nothing, nothing in vain from
me.&nbsp; You ask his life; I give it you, as I would give you my
soul; as I would give you my life, if I had any left.&nbsp; My
life is done; you have taken it.&nbsp; Not a hope, not an end;
not even revenge.&nbsp; (<i>He sits</i>.)&nbsp; Dorothy, you see
your work.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; O God, forgive
me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; Ay, Dorothy, He
will, as I do.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; As you do?&nbsp; Do
you forgive me, John?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; Ay, more than that,
poor soul.&nbsp; I said my life was done, I was wrong; I have
still a duty.&nbsp; It is not in vain you taught me; I shall
still prove to you that it was not in vain.&nbsp; You shall soon
find that I am no backward friend.&nbsp; Farewell.</p>

<h4>SCENE I</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Austin</span>,
<span class="smcap">Menteith</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Menteith</span>.&nbsp; At the
barber&rsquo;s, Mr. George, I had the pleasure of meeting two of
the Dook&rsquo;s gentlemen.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Well, and was his
Royal Highness satisfied with his quarters?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Menteith</span>.&nbsp; Quite so, Mr.
George.&nbsp; Delighted, I believe.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; I am rejoiced to hear
it.&nbsp; I wish I could say I was as pleased with my journey,
Menteith.&nbsp; This is the first time I ever came to the Wells
in another person&rsquo;s carriage; Duke or not, it shall be the
last, Menteith.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Menteith</span>.&nbsp; Ah, Mr. George, no
wonder.&nbsp; And how many times have we made that journey back
and forth?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Enough to make us
older than we look.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Menteith</span>.&nbsp; To be sure, Mr.
George, you do wear well.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; <i>We</i> wear well,
Menteith.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Menteith</span>.&nbsp; I hear, Mr. George,
that Miss Musgrave is of the company.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Is she so?&nbsp;
Well, well! well, well!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Menteith</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve not seen
the young lady myself, Mr. George; but the barber tells me
she&rsquo;s looking poorly.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Poorly?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Menteith</span>.&nbsp; Yes, Mr. George,
poorly was his word.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Well, Menteith, I am
truly sorry.&nbsp; She is not the first.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Menteith</span>.&nbsp; Yes, Mr.
George.&nbsp; (<i>A bell</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Menteith</span> <i>goes out</i>, <i>and re-enters
with card</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span> (<i>with card</i>).&nbsp;
Whom have we here?&nbsp; Anthony Musgrave?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Menteith</span>.&nbsp; A fine young man,
Mr. George; and with a look of the young lady, but not so
gentlemanly.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; You have an eye, you
have an eye.&nbsp; Let him in.</p>
<h4>SCENE II</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Austin</span>,
<span class="smcap">Menteith</span>, <span
class="smcap">Anthony</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; I am charmed to have
this opportunity, Mr. Musgrave.&nbsp; You belong to my old corps,
I think?&nbsp; And how does my good friend, Sir Frederick?&nbsp;
I had his line; but like all my old comrades, he thinks last
about himself, and gives me not of his news.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; I protest, sir, this
is a very proud moment.&nbsp; Your name is still remembered in
the regiment.&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">Austin</span>
<i>bows</i>.)&nbsp; The Colonel&mdash;he keeps his health, sir,
considering his age (<span class="smcap">Austin</span> <i>bows
again</i>, <i>and looks at</i> <span
class="smcap">Menteith</span>)&mdash;tells us young men you were
a devil of a fellow in your time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; I believe I
was&mdash;in my time.&nbsp; Menteith, give Mr. Musgrave a dish of
chocolate.&nbsp; So, sir, we see you at the Wells.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; I have but just
alighted.&nbsp; I had but one thought, sir: to pay my respects to
Mr. Austin.&nbsp; I have not yet kissed my aunt and sister.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; In my time&mdash;to
which you refer&mdash;the ladies had come first.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; The women?&nbsp; I
take you, sir.&nbsp; But then you see, a man&rsquo;s relatives
don&rsquo;t count.&nbsp; And besides, Mr. Austin, between men of
the world, I am fairly running away from the sex: I am positively
in flight.&nbsp; Little Hortense of the Opera; you know; she sent
her love to you.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s mad about me, I think.&nbsp;
You never saw a creature so fond.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Well, well, child!
you are better here.&nbsp; In my time&mdash;to which you have
referred&mdash;I knew the lady.&nbsp; Does she wear well?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; I beg your pardon,
sir!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; No offence, child, no
offence.&nbsp; She was a very lively creature.&nbsp; But you
neglect your chocolate I see?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t
patronise it, Mr. Austin; we haven&rsquo;t for some years: the
service has quite changed since your time.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d be
surprised.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Doubtless.&nbsp; I
am.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; I assure you, sir, I
and Jack Bosbury of the Fifty-Second&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; The Hampshire
Bosburys?&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; I do not know
exactly, sir.&nbsp; I believe he is related.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Or perhaps&mdash;I
remember a Mr. Bosbury, a cutter of coats.&nbsp; I have the
vanity to believe I formed his business.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; I&mdash;I hope not,
sir.&nbsp; But as I was saying, I and this Jack Bosbury, and the
Brummagem Bantam&mdash;a very pretty light-weight,
sir&mdash;drank seven bottles of Burgundy to the three of us
inside the eighty minutes.&nbsp; Jack, sir, was a little cut; but
me and the Bantam went out and finished the evening on hot
gin.&nbsp; Life, sir, life!&nbsp; Tom Cribb was with us.&nbsp; He
spoke of you, too, Tom did: said you&rsquo;d given him a wrinkle
for his second fight with the black man.&nbsp; No, sir, I assure
you, you&rsquo;re not forgotten.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span> (<i>bows</i>).&nbsp; I am
pleased to learn it.&nbsp; In my time, I had an esteem for Mr.
Cribb.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; O come, sir! but
your time cannot be said to be over.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Menteith, you
hear?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Menteith</span>.&nbsp; Yes, Mr.
George.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; The Colonel told me
that you liked to shake an elbow.&nbsp; Your big main, sir, with
Lord Wensleydale, is often talked about.&nbsp; I hope I may have
the occasion to sit down with you.&nbsp; I shall count it an
honour, I assure you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; But would your aunt,
my very good friend, approve?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; Why, sir, you do not
suppose I am in leading-strings?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; You forget, child: a
family must hang together.&nbsp; When I was young&mdash;in my
time&mdash;I was alone; and what I did concerned myself.&nbsp;
But a youth who has&mdash;as I think you have&mdash;a family of
ladies to protect, must watch his honour, child, and preserve his
fortune.&nbsp; You have no commands from Sir Frederick?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; None, sir, none.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Shall I find you this
noon upon the Pantiles? . . . I shall be charmed.&nbsp; Commend
me to your aunt and your fair sister.&nbsp; Menteith?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Menteith</span>.&nbsp; Yes, Mr.
George.&nbsp; (<i>Shows Anthony out</i>.)</p>
<h4>SCENE III</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Austin</span>,
<span class="smcap">Menteith</span>, <i>returning</i></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Was I ever like that,
Menteith?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Menteith</span>.&nbsp; No, Mr. George, you
was always a gentleman.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Youth, my good
fellow, youth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Menteith</span>.&nbsp; Quite so, Mr.
George.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Well, Menteith, we
cannot make no mend.&nbsp; We cannot play the jockey with
Time.&nbsp; Age is the test: of wine, Menteith, and men.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Menteith</span>.&nbsp; Me and you and the
old Hermitage, Mr. George, he-he!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; And the best of
these, the Hermitage.&nbsp; But come: we lose our day.&nbsp; Help
me off with this.&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">Menteith</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Will the hair do,
Menteith?</p>

<h4>SCENE IV</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Austin</span>,
<i>R. to him</i> <span class="smcap">Menteith</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Fenwick</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Menteith</span> (<i>announcing</i>).&nbsp;
Mr. Fenwick, Mr. George.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; At the name of Miss
Musgrave, my doors fly always open.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; I believe, sir, you
are acquainted with my cousin, Richard Gaunt?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; The county
member?&nbsp; An old and good friend.&nbsp; But you need not go
so far afield: I know your good house of Allonby Shaw since the
days of the Black Knight.&nbsp; We are, in fact, and at a very
royal distance, cousins.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; I desired, sir, from
the nature of my business, that you should recognise me for a
gentleman.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; The preliminary, sir,
is somewhat grave.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; My business is both
grave and delicate.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Menteith, my good
fellow.&nbsp; (<i>Exit</i> <span
class="smcap">Menteith</span>.)&nbsp; Mr. Fenwick, honour me so
far as to be seated.&nbsp; (<i>They sit</i>.)&nbsp; I await your
pleasure.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; Briefly, sir, I am
come, not without hope, to appeal to your good heart.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; From Miss
Musgrave?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; No, sir, I abused
her name, and am here upon my own authority.&nbsp; Upon me the
consequence.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Proceed</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; Mr. Austin, Dorothy
Musgrave is the oldest and dearest of my friends, is the lady
whom for ten years it has been my hope to make my wife.&nbsp; She
has shown me reason to discard that hope for another: that I may
call her Mrs. Austin.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; In the best interests
of the lady (<i>rising</i>) I question if you have been well
inspired.&nbsp; You are aware, sir, that from such interference
there is but one issue: to whom shall I address my friend?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; Mr. Austin, I am
here to throw myself upon your mercy.&nbsp; Strange as my errand
is, it will seem yet more strange to you that I came prepared to
accept at your hands any extremity of dishonour and not
fight.&nbsp; The lady whom it is my boast to serve has honoured
me with her commands.&nbsp; These are my law, and by these your
life is sacred.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Then, sir (<i>with
his hand upon the bell</i>), his conversation becomes
impossible.&nbsp; You have me at too gross a disadvantage; and,
as you are a gentleman and respect another, I would suggest that
you retire.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; Sir, you speak of
disadvantage; think of mine.&nbsp; All my life long, with all the
forces of my nature, I have loved this lady.&nbsp; I came here to
implore her to be my wife, to be my queen; my saint she had been
always!&nbsp; She was too noble to deceive me.&nbsp; She told me
what you know.&nbsp; I will not conceal that my first mood was of
anger: I would have killed you like a dog.&nbsp; But, Mr.
Austin&mdash;bear with me awhile&mdash;I, on the threshold of my
life, who have made no figure in the world, nor ever shall now,
who had but one treasure, and have lost it&mdash;if I, abandoning
revenge, trampling upon jealousy, can supplicate you to complete
my misfortune&mdash;O Mr. Austin! you who have lived, you whose
gallantry is beyond the insolence of a suspicion, you who are a
man crowned and acclaimed, who are loved, and loved by such a
woman&mdash;you who excel me in every point of advantage, will
you suffer me to surpass you in generosity?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; You speak from the
heart.&nbsp; (<i>Sits</i>.)&nbsp; What do you want with me?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; Marry her.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Mr. Fenwick, I am the
older man.&nbsp; I have seen much of life, much of society, much
of love.&nbsp; When I was young, it was expected of a gentleman
to be ready with his hat to a lady, ready with his sword to a
man; to honour his word and his king; to be courteous with his
equals, generous to his dependants, helpful and trusty in
friendship.&nbsp; But it was not asked of us to be
quixotic.&nbsp; If I had married every lady by whom it is my
fortune&mdash;not my merit&mdash;to have been distinguished, the
Wells would scarce be spacious enough for my establishment.&nbsp;
You see, sir, that while I respect your emotion, I am myself
conducted by experience.&nbsp; And besides, Mr. Fenwick, is not
love a warfare? has it not rules? have not our fair antagonists
their tactics, their weapons, their place of arms? and is there
not a touch of&mdash;pardon me the word! of silliness in one who,
having fought, and having vanquished, sounds a parley, and
capitulates to his own prisoner?&nbsp; Had the lady chosen, had
the fortune of war been other, &rsquo;tis like she had been Mrs.
Austin.&nbsp; Now I . . . You know the world.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; I know, sir, that
the world contains much cowardice.&nbsp; To find Mr. Austin
afraid to do the right, this surprises me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Afraid, child?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; Yes, sir,
afraid.&nbsp; You know her, you know if she be worthy; and you
answer me with&mdash;the world: the world which has been at your
feet: the world which Mr. Austin knows so well how to value and
is so able to rule.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; I have lived long
enough, Mr. Fenwick, to recognise that the world is a great
power.&nbsp; It can make; but it can break.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; Sir, suffer me: you
spoke but now of friendship, and spoke warmly.&nbsp; Have you
forgotten Colonel Villiers?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Mr. Fenwick, Mr.
Fenwick, you forget what I have suffered.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; O sir, I know you
loved him.&nbsp; And yet, for a random word you quarrelled;
friendship was weighed in vain against the world&rsquo;s code of
honour; you fought, and your friend fell.&nbsp; I have heard from
others how he lay long in agony, and how you watched and nursed
him, and it was in your embrace he died.&nbsp; In God&rsquo;s
name have you forgotten that?&nbsp; Was not this sacrifice
enough? or must the world, once again, step between Mr. Austin
and his generous heart?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Good God, sir, I
believe you are in the right; I believe, upon my soul I believe,
there is something in what you say.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; Something, Mr.
Austin?&nbsp; O credit me, the whole difference betwixt good and
evil.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Nay, nay, but there
you go too far.&nbsp; There are many kinds of good: honour is a
diamond cut in a thousand facets, and with the true fire in
each.&nbsp; Thus, and with all our differences, Mr. Fenwick, you
and I can still respect, we can still admire each other.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; Bear with me still,
sir, if I ask you what is the end of life but to excel in
generosity?&nbsp; To pity the weak, to comfort the afflicted, to
right where we have wronged, to be brave in
reparation&mdash;these noble elements you have; for of what
besides is the fabric of your dealing with Colonel
Villiers?&nbsp; That is man&rsquo;s chivalry to man.&nbsp; Yet to
a suffering woman&mdash;a woman feeble, betrayed,
unconsoled&mdash;you deny your clemency, you refuse your aid, you
proffer injustice for atonement.&nbsp; Nay, you are so disloyal
to yourself that you can choose to be ungenerous and
unkind.&nbsp; Where, sir, is the honour?&nbsp; What facet of the
diamond is that?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; You forget, sir, you
forget.&nbsp; But go on.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; O sir, not
I&mdash;not I but yourself forgets: George Austin forgets George
Austin.&nbsp; A woman loved by him, betrayed by him, abandoned by
him&mdash;that woman suffers; and a point of honour keeps him
from his place at her feet.&nbsp; She has played and lost, and
the world is with him if he deign to exact the stakes.&nbsp; Is
that the Mr. Austin whom Miss Musgrave honoured with her
trust?&nbsp; Then, sir, how miserably was she deceived!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp;
Child&mdash;child&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; Mr. Austin, still
bear with me, still follow me.&nbsp; O sir, will you not picture
that dear lady&rsquo;s life?&nbsp; Her years how few, her error
thus irreparable, what henceforth can be her portion but remorse,
the consciousness of self-abasement, the shame of knowing that
her trust was ill-bestowed?&nbsp; To think of it: this was a
queen among women; and this&mdash;this is George Austin&rsquo;s
work!&nbsp; Sir, let me touch your heart: let me prevail with you
to feel that &rsquo;tis impossible.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; I am a
gentleman.&nbsp; What do you ask of me?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; To be the man she
loved: to be clement where the world would have you triumph, to
be of equal generosity with the vanquished, to be worthy of her
sacrifice and of yourself.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Mr. Fenwick, your
reproof is harsh&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span> (<i>interrupting
him</i>).&nbsp; O sir, be, just be just!&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; But it is merited,
and I thank you for its utterance.&nbsp; You tell me that the
true victory comes when the fight is won: that our foe is never
so noble nor so dangerous as when she is fallen, that the
crowning triumph is that we celebrate over our conquering
selves.&nbsp; Sir, you are right.&nbsp; Kindness, ay kindness
after all.&nbsp; And with age, to become clement.&nbsp; Yes,
ambition first; then, the rounded vanity&mdash;victory still
novel; and last, as you say, the royal mood of the mature man; to
abdicate for others . . . Sir, you touched me hard about my dead
friend; still harder about my living duty; and I am not so young
but I can take a lesson.&nbsp; There is my hand upon it: she
shall be my wife.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; Ah, Mr. Austin, I
was sure of it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Then, sir, you were
vastly mistaken.&nbsp; There is nothing of Beau Austin
here.&nbsp; I have simply, my dear child, sate at the feet of Mr.
Fenwick.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; Ah, sir, your heart
was counsellor enough.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Pardon me.&nbsp; I am
vain enough to be the judge: there are but two people in the
world who could have wrought this change: yourself and that dear
lady.&nbsp; (<i>Touches bell</i>.)&nbsp; Suffer me to dismiss
you.&nbsp; One instant of toilet, and I follow.&nbsp; Will you do
me the honour to go before, and announce my approach?&nbsp;
(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Menteith</span>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; Sir, if my
admiration&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Dear child, the
admiration is the other way.&nbsp; (<i>Embraces him</i>.&nbsp;

<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Upon my word, I think
the world is getting better.&nbsp; We were none of us young men
like that&mdash;in my time, to quote my future brother.&nbsp;
(<i>He sits down before the mirror</i>.)&nbsp; Well, here ends
Beau Austin.&nbsp; Paris, Rome, Vienna, London&mdash;victor
everywhere: and now he must leave his bones in Tunbridge
Wells.&nbsp; (<i>Looks at his leg</i>.)&nbsp; Poor Dolly
Musgrave! a good girl after all, and will make me a good wife;
none better.&nbsp; The last&mdash;of how many?&mdash;ay, and the
best!&nbsp; Walks like Hebe.&nbsp; But still, here ends Beau
Austin.&nbsp; Perhaps it&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; Poor Dolly&mdash;was
she looking poorly?&nbsp; She shall have her wish.&nbsp; Well, we
grow older, but we grow no worse.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Austin</span>,

<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Menteith, I am going
to be married.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Menteith</span>.&nbsp; Well, Mr. George,
but I am pleased to hear it.&nbsp; Miss Musgrave is a most
elegant lady.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Ay, Mr. Menteith? and
who told you the lady&rsquo;s name?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Menteith</span>.&nbsp; Mr. George, you was
always a gentleman.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; You mean I
wasn&rsquo;t always?&nbsp; Old boy, you are in the right.&nbsp;
This shall be a good change for both you and me.&nbsp; We have
lived too long like a brace of truants: now is the time to draw
about the fire.&nbsp; How much is left of the old Hermitage?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Menteith</span>.&nbsp; Hard upon thirty
dozen, Mr. George, and not a bad cork in the bin.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; And a mistress,
Menteith, that&rsquo;s worthy of that wine.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Menteith</span>.&nbsp; Mr. George, sir,
she&rsquo;s worthy of you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Gad, I believe
it.&nbsp; (<i>Shakes hands with him</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Menteith</span> (<i>breaking
down</i>).&nbsp; Mr. George, you&rsquo;ve been a damned good
master to me, and I&rsquo;ve been a damned good servant to you;
we&rsquo;ve been proud of each other from the first; but if
you&rsquo;ll excuse my plainness, Mr. George, I never liked you
better than to-day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Cheer up, old boy,
the best is yet to come.&nbsp; Get out the tongs, and curl me
like a bridegroom.&nbsp; (<i>Sits before dressing-glass</i>;

<p><span class="smcap">Musical Induction</span>: the
&lsquo;Minuet&rsquo; from &lsquo;<i>Don Giovanni</i>&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>The stage represents Miss Foster&rsquo;s lodging as in Act
I</i>.</p>
<h4>SCENE I</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>,
R., <i>at tambour</i>; <span class="smcap">Anthony</span>,
<i>C.</i>, <i>bestriding chair</i>; <span class="smcap">Miss
Foster</span>, <i>L.C.</i></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; Yes, ma&rsquo;am, I
like my regiment: we are all gentlemen, from old Fred downwards,
and all of a good family.&nbsp; Indeed, so are all my friends,
except one tailor sort of fellow, Bosbury.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m
done with him.&nbsp; I assure you, Aunt Evelina, we are
Corinthian to the last degree.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t shock you
ladies for the world&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t mind
me, my dear; go on.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; Really, ma&rsquo;am,
you must pardon me: I trust I understand what topics are to be
avoided among females&mdash;And before my sister, too!&nbsp; A
girl of her age!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; Why, you dear, silly
fellow, I&rsquo;m old enough to be your mother.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; My dear Dolly, you
do not understand; you are not a man of the world.&nbsp; But, as
I was going on to say, there is no more spicy regiment in the
service.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; I am not
surprised that it maintains its old reputation.&nbsp; You know,
my dear (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>), it was
George Austin&rsquo;s regiment.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; Was it, aunt?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; Beau Austin?&nbsp;
Yes, it was; and a precious dust they make about him
still&mdash;a parcel of old frumps!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I went
to see him.&nbsp; But he&rsquo;s quite extinct: he couldn&rsquo;t
be Corinthian if he tried.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; I am afraid that
even at your age George Austin held a very different position
from the distinguished Anthony Musgrave.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; Come, ma&rsquo;am, I
take that unkindly.&nbsp; Of course I know what you&rsquo;re at:
of course the old p&ucirc;t cut no end of a dash with the
Duchess.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; My dear child, I
was thinking of no such thing; <i>that</i> was immoral.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; Then you mean that
affair at Brighton: when he cut the Prince about Perdita
Robinson.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; No, I had
forgotten it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; O, well, I
know&mdash;that duel!&nbsp; But look here, Aunt Evelina, I
don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d be much gratified after all if I
were to be broke for killing my commanding officer about a
quarrel at cards.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; Nobody asks you,
Anthony, to imitate Mr. Austin.&nbsp; I trust you will set
yourself a better model.&nbsp; But you may choose a worse.&nbsp;
With all his faults, and all his enemies, Mr. Austin is a pattern
gentleman: You would not ask a man to be braver, and there are
few so generous.&nbsp; I cannot bear to hear him called in fault
by one so young.&nbsp; Better judges, dear, are better
pleased.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; Hey-day!
what&rsquo;s this?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; Why, Dolly, this
is April and May.&nbsp; You surprise me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; I am afraid, indeed,
madam, that you have much to suffer from my caprice.&nbsp;
(<i>She goes out</i>, <i>L.</i>)</p>
<h4>SCENE II</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>,
<span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; What is the meaning
of all this, ma&rsquo;am?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; Nothing, child,
that I know.&nbsp; You spoke of Mr. Austin, our dear friend, like
a groom; and she, like any lady of taste, took arms in his
defence.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; No, ma&rsquo;am,
that won&rsquo;t do.&nbsp; I know the sex.&nbsp; You mark my
words, the girl has some confounded nonsense in her head, and
wants looking after.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; In my presence,
Anthony, I shall ask you to speak of Dorothy with greater
respect.&nbsp; With your permission, your sister and I will
continue to direct our own affairs.&nbsp; When we require the
interference of so young and confident a champion, you shall
know.&nbsp; (<i>Curtsies</i>, <i>kisses her hand</i>, <i>and goes
out</i>, <i>L.</i>)</p>
<h4>SCENE III</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Anthony</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; Upon my word, I
think Aunt Evelina one of the most uncivil old women in the
world.&nbsp; Nine weeks ago I came of age; and they still treat
me like a boy.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a recognised Corinthian, too: take
my liquor with old Fred, and go round with the Brummagem Bantam
and Jack Bosb&mdash; . . . O damn Jack Bosbury.&nbsp; If his
father was a tailor, he shall fight me for his ungentlemanly
conduct.&nbsp; However, that&rsquo;s all one.&nbsp; What I want
is to make Aunt Evelina understand that I&rsquo;m not the man to
be put down by an old maid who&rsquo;s been brought up in a
work-basket, begad!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had nothing but rebuffs all
day.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very remarkable.&nbsp; There was that man
Austin, to begin with.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be hanged if I can stand
him.&nbsp; I hear too much of him; and if I can only get a good
excuse to put him to the door, I believe it would give Dorothy
and all of us a kind of a position.&nbsp; After all, he&rsquo;s
not a man to visit in the house of ladies: not when I&rsquo;m
away, at least.&nbsp; Nothing in it of course; but is he a man
whose visits I can sanction?</p>
<h4>SCENE IV</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>,
<span class="smcap">Barbara</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; Please, Mr. Anthony,
Miss Foster said I was to show your room.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp;
Baby?&nbsp; Now, you come here.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a girl of
sense, I know.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; La, Mr. Anthony, I
hope I&rsquo;m nothing of the kind.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; Come, come!
that&rsquo;s not the tone I want: I&rsquo;m serious.&nbsp; Does
this man Austin come much about the house?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; O Mr. Anthony, for
shame!&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you ask Miss Foster?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; Now I wish you to
understand: I&rsquo;m the head of this family.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
my business to look after my sister&rsquo;s reputation, and my
aunt&rsquo;s too, begad!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m here
for: I&rsquo;m their natural protector.&nbsp; And what I want
you, Barbara Ridley, to understand&mdash;you whose fathers have
served my fathers&mdash;is just simply this: if you&rsquo;ve any
common gratitude, you&rsquo;re bound to help me in the
work.&nbsp; Now Barbara, you know me, and you know my Aunt
Evelina.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a good enough woman; I&rsquo;m the
first to say so.&nbsp; But who is she to take care of a young
girl?&nbsp; She&rsquo;s ignorant of the world to that degree she
believes in Beau Austin!&nbsp; Now you and I, Bab, who are not so
high and dry, see through and through him; we know that a man
like that is no fit company for any inexperienced girl.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; O Mr. Anthony,
don&rsquo;t say that.&nbsp; (<i>Weeping</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; Hullo! what&rsquo;s
wrong?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; Nothing that I know
of.&nbsp; O Mr. Anthony, I don&rsquo;t think there can be
anything.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; Think?&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t think?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s this?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; O sir!&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know, and yet I don&rsquo;t like it.&nbsp;
Here&rsquo;s my beautiful necklace all broke to bits: she took it
off my very neck, and gave me her birthday pearls instead; and I
found it afterwards on the table, all smashed to pieces; and all
she wanted it for was to take and break it.&nbsp; Why that?&nbsp;
It frightens me, Mr. Anthony, it frightens me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>with
necklace</i>).&nbsp; This?&nbsp; What has this trumpery to do
with us?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; He gave it me:
that&rsquo;s why she broke it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; He? who?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; Mr. Austin did; and
I do believe I should not have taken it, Mr. Anthony, but I
thought no harm, upon my word of honour.&nbsp; He was always
here: that was six months ago; and indeed, indeed, I thought they
were to marry.&nbsp; How would I think else with a born lady like
Miss Dorothy?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; Why, Barbara, God
help us all, what&rsquo;s this?&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t mean to say
that there was&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; Here it is, as true
as true: they were going for a jaunt; and Miss Foster had her
gout; and I was to go with them; and he told me to make-believe I
was ill; and I did; and I stayed at home; and he gave me that
necklace; and they went away together; and, oh dear!&nbsp; I wish
I&rsquo;d never been born.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; Together? he and
Dolly?&nbsp; Good Lord! my sister!&nbsp; And since then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; We haven&rsquo;t
seen him from that day to this, the wicked villain; and, Mr.
Anthony, he hasn&rsquo;t so much as written the poor dear a
word.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; Bab, Bab, Bab, this
is a devil of a bad business; this is a cruel bad business, Baby;
cruel upon me, cruel upon all of us; a family like mine.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m a young man, Barbara, to have this delicate affair to
manage; but, thank God, I&rsquo;m Musgrave to the bone.&nbsp; He
bribed a servant-maid, did he?&nbsp; I keep his bribe; it&rsquo;s
mine now; dear bought, by George!&nbsp; He shall have it in his
teeth.&nbsp; Shot Colonel Villiers, did he? we&rsquo;ll see how
he faces Anthony Musgrave.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a good girl,
Barbara; so far you&rsquo;ve served the family.&nbsp; You leave
this to me.&nbsp; And, hark ye, dry your eyes and hold your
tongue: I&rsquo;ll have no scandal raised by you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; I do hope, sir, you
won&rsquo;t use me against Miss Dorothy.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my
affair; your business is to hold your tongue.&nbsp; Miss Dorothy
has made her bed and must lie on it.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s Jack
Fenwick.&nbsp; You can go.</p>
<h4>SCENE V</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>,
<span class="smcap">Fenwick</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; Jack Fenwick, is
that you?&nbsp; Come here, my boy.&nbsp; Jack, you&rsquo;ve given
me many a thrashing, and I deserved &rsquo;em; and I&rsquo;ll not
see you made a fool of now.&nbsp; George Austin is a damned
villain, and Dorothy Musgrave is no girl for you to marry: God
help me that I should have to say it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; Good God, who told
<i>you</i>?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; Ay, Jack; it&rsquo;s
hard on me, Jack.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;ll stand my friend in spite
of this, and you&rsquo;ll take my message to the man, won&rsquo;t
you?&nbsp; For it&rsquo;s got to come to blood, Jack:
there&rsquo;s no way out of that.&nbsp; And perhaps your poor
friend will fall, Jack; think of that: like Villiers.&nbsp; And
all for an unworthy sister.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; Now, Anthony
Musgrave, I give you fair warning; see you take it: one word more
against your sister, and we quarrel.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; You let it slip
yourself, Jack: you know yourself she&rsquo;s not a virtuous
girl.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; What do you know of
virtue, whose whole boast is to be vicious?&nbsp; How dare you
draw conclusions?&nbsp; Dolt and puppy! you can no more
comprehend that angel&rsquo;s excellencies than she can stoop to
believe in your vices.&nbsp; And you talk morality?&nbsp;
Anthony, I&rsquo;m a man who has been somewhat roughly tried:
take care.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t seem
able to grasp the situation, Jack.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very
remarkable; I&rsquo;m the girl&rsquo;s natural protector; and you
should buckle-to and help, like a friend of the family.&nbsp; And
instead of that, begad! you turn on me like all the rest.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; Now mark me fairly:
Mr. Austin follows at my heels; he comes to offer marriage to
your sister&mdash;that is all you know, and all you shall know;
and if by any misplaced insolence of yours this marriage should
miscarry, you have to answer, not to Mr. Austin only, but to
me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all a
most discreditable business, and I don&rsquo;t see how you
propose to better it by cutting my throat.&nbsp; Of course if
he&rsquo;s going to marry her, it&rsquo;s a different thing; but
I don&rsquo;t believe he is, or he&rsquo;d have asked me.&nbsp;
You think me a fool?&nbsp; Well see they marry, or they&rsquo;ll
find me a dangerous fool.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; You will do me the
justice to acknowledge, Mr. Fenwick, that I have been not long
delayed by my devotion to the Graces.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; So, sir, I find you
in my house&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; And charmed to meet
you again.&nbsp; It went against my conscience to separate so
soon.&nbsp; Youth, Mr. Musgrave, is to us older men a perpetual
refreshment.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; You came here, sir,
I suppose, upon some errand?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; My errand, Mr.
Musgrave, is to your fair sister.&nbsp; Beauty, as you know,
comes before valour.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; In my own house, and
about my own sister, I presume I have the right to ask for
something more explicit.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; The right, my dear
sir, is beyond question; but it is one, as you were going on to
observe, on which no gentleman insists.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; Anthony, my good
fellow, I think we had better go.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; I have asked a
question.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Which I was charmed
to answer, but which, on repetition, might begin to grow
distasteful.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; In my own
house&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; For God&rsquo;s
sake, Anthony!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; In your aunt&rsquo;s
house, young gentleman, I shall be careful to refrain from
criticism.&nbsp; I am come upon a visit to a lady: that visit I
shall pay; when you desire (if it be possible that you desire it)
to resume this singular conversation, select some fitter
place.&nbsp; Mr. Fenwick, this afternoon, may I present you to
his Royal Highness?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; Why, sir, I believe
you must have misconceived me.&nbsp; I have no wish to offend: at
least at present.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Enough, sir.&nbsp; I
was persuaded I had heard amiss.&nbsp; I trust we shall be
friends.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; Come, Anthony, come:

<h4>SCENE VII</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Austin</span>,
<span class="smcap">Dorothy</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; I am told, Mr.
Austin, that you wish to see me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Madam, can you doubt
of that desire? can you question my sincerity?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; Sir, between you and
me these compliments are worse than idle: they are unkind.&nbsp;
Sure, we are alone!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; I find you in an hour
of cruelty, I fear.&nbsp; Yet you have condescended to receive
this poor offender; and having done so much, you will not refuse
to give him audience.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; You shall have no
cause, sir, to complain of me.&nbsp; I listen.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; My fair friend, I
have sent myself&mdash;a poor ambassador&mdash;to plead for your
forgiveness.&nbsp; I have been too long absent; too long, I would
fain hope, madam, for you; too long for my honour and my
love.&nbsp; I am no longer, madam, in my first youth; but I may
say that I am not unknown.&nbsp; My fortune, originally small,
has not suffered from my husbandry.&nbsp; I have excellent
health, an excellent temper, and the purest ardour of affection
for your person.&nbsp; I found not on my merits, but on your
indulgence.&nbsp; Miss Musgrave, will you honour me with your
hand in marriage?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; Mr. Austin, if I
thought basely of marriage, I should perhaps accept your
offer.&nbsp; There was a time, indeed, when it would have made me
proudest among women.&nbsp; I was the more deceived, and have to
thank you for a salutary lesson.&nbsp; You chose to count me as a
cipher in your rolls of conquest; for six months you left me to
my fate; and you come here to-day&mdash;prompted, I doubt not, by
an honourable impulse&mdash;to offer this tardy reparation.&nbsp;
No: it is too late.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Do you refuse?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; Yours is the blame:
we are no longer equal.&nbsp; You have robbed me of the right to
marry any one but you; and do you think me, then, so poor in
spirit as to accept a husband on compulsion?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Dorothy, you loved me
once.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; Ay, you will never
guess how much: you will never live to understand how ignominious
a defeat that conquest was.&nbsp; I loved and trusted you: I
judged you by myself; think, then, of my humiliation, when, at
the touch of trial, all your qualities proved false, and I beheld
you the slave of the meanest vanity&mdash;selfish, untrue,
base!&nbsp; Think, sir, what a humbling of my pride to have been
thus deceived: to have taken for my idol such a commonplace
imposture as yourself; to have loved&mdash;yes, loved&mdash;such
a shadow, such a mockery of man.&nbsp; And now I am unworthy to
be the wife of any gentleman; and you&mdash;look me in the face,
George&mdash;are you worthy to be my husband?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; No, Dorothy, I am
not.&nbsp; I was a vain fool; I blundered away the most precious
opportunity; and my regret will be lifelong.&nbsp; Do me the
justice to accept this full confession of my fault.&nbsp; I am
here to-day to own and to repair it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; Repair it?&nbsp; Sir
you condescend too far.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; I perceive with shame
how grievously I had misjudged you.&nbsp; But now, Dorothy,
believe me, my eyes are opened.&nbsp; I plead with you, not as my
equal, but as one in all ways better than myself.&nbsp; I admire
you, not in that trivial sense in which we men are wont to speak
of women, but as God&rsquo;s work: as a wise mind, a noble soul,
and a most generous heart, from whose society I have all to gain,
all to learn.&nbsp; Dorothy, in one word, I love you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; And what, sir, has
wrought this transformation?&nbsp; You knew me of old, or thought
you knew me?&nbsp; Is it in six months of selfish absence that
your mind has changed?&nbsp; When did that change begin?&nbsp; A
week ago?&nbsp; Sure, you would have written!&nbsp; To-day?&nbsp;
Sir, if this offer be anything more than fresh offence, I have a
right to be enlightened.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Madam, I foresaw this
question.&nbsp; So be it: I respect, and I will not deceive
you.&nbsp; But give me, first of all, a moment for defence.&nbsp;
There are few men of my habits and position who would have done
as I have done: sate at the feet of a young boy, accepted his
lessons, gone upon his errand: fewer still, who would thus, at
the crisis of a love, risk the whole fortune of the
soul&mdash;love, gratitude, even respect.&nbsp; Yet more than
that!&nbsp; For conceive how I respect you, if I, whose lifelong
trade has been flattery, stand before you and make the plain
confession of a truth that must not only lower me, but deeply
wound yourself.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; What
means&mdash;?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Young Fenwick, my
rival for your heart, he it was that sent me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; He?&nbsp; O
disgrace!&nbsp; He sent you!&nbsp; That was what he meant?&nbsp;
Am I fallen so low?&nbsp; Am I your common talk among men?&nbsp;
Did you dice for me?&nbsp; Did he kneel?&nbsp; O John, John, how
could you!&nbsp; And you, Mr. Austin, whither have you brought me
down? shame heaping upon shame&mdash;to what end! oh, to what
end?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Madam, you wound me:
you look wilfully amiss.&nbsp; Sure, any lady in the land might
well be proud to be loved as you are loved, with such nobility as
Mr. Fenwick&rsquo;s, with such humility as mine.&nbsp; I came,
indeed, in pity, in good-nature, what you will.&nbsp; (See,
dearest lady, with what honesty I speak: if I win you, it shall
be with the unblemished truth.)&nbsp; All that is gone.&nbsp;
Pity? it is myself I pity.&nbsp; I offer you not love&mdash;I am
not worthy.&nbsp; I ask, I beseech of you: suffer me to wait upon
you like a servant, to serve you with my rank, my name, the whole
devotion of my life.&nbsp; I am a gentleman&mdash;ay, in spite of
my fault&mdash;an upright gentleman; and I swear to you that you
shall order your life and mine at your free will.&nbsp; Dorothy,
at your feet, in remorse, in respect, in love&mdash;O such love
as I have never felt, such love as I derided&mdash;I implore, I
conjure you to be mine!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; Too late! too
late.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; No, no, not too late:
not too late for penitence, not too late for love.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; Which do you
propose? that I should abuse your compassion, or reward your
treachery?&nbsp; George Austin, I have been your mistress, and I
will never be your wife.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Child, dear child, I
have not told you all: there is worse still: your brother knows;
the boy as good as told me.&nbsp; Dorothy, this is scandal at the
door&mdash;O let that move you: for that, if not for my sake, for
that, if not for love, trust me, trust me again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; I am so much the
more your victim: that is all, and shall that change my
heart?&nbsp; The sin must have its wages.&nbsp; This, too, was
done long ago: when you stooped to lie to me.&nbsp; The shame is
still mine, the fault still yours.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Child, child, you
kill me: you will not understand.&nbsp; Can you not see? the lad
will force me to a duel.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; And you will kill
him?&nbsp; Shame after shame, threat upon threat.&nbsp; Marry me,
or you are dishonoured; marry me, or your brother dies: and this
is man&rsquo;s honour!&nbsp; But my honour and my pride are
different.&nbsp; I will encounter all misfortune sooner than
degrade myself by an unfaithful marriage.&nbsp; How should I
kneel before the altar, and vow to reverence as my husband you,
you who deceived me as my lover?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Dorothy, you misjudge
me cruelly; I have deserved it.&nbsp; You will not take me for
your husband; why should I wonder?&nbsp; You are right.&nbsp; I
have indeed filled your life with calamity: the wages, ay, the
wages, of my sin are heavy upon you.&nbsp; But I have one more
thing to ask of your pity; and O remember, child, who it is that
asks it: a man guilty in your sight, void of excuse, but old, and
very proud, and most unused to supplication.&nbsp; Dorothy
Musgrave, will you forgive George Austin?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; O, George!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; It is the old name:
that is all I ask, and more than I deserve.&nbsp; I shall
remember, often remember, how and where it was bestowed upon me
for the last time.&nbsp; I thank you, Dorothy, from my heart; a
heart, child, that has been too long silent, but is not too old,
I thank God! not yet too old, to learn a lesson and to accept a
reproof.&nbsp; I will not keep you longer: I will go&mdash;I am
so bankrupt in credit that I dare not ask you to believe in how
much sorrow.&nbsp; But, Dorothy, my acts will speak for me with
more persuasion.&nbsp; If it be in my power, you shall suffer no
more through me: I will avoid your brother; I will leave this
place, I will leave England, to-morrow; you shall be no longer
tortured with the neighbourhood of your ungenerous lover.&nbsp;
Dorothy, farewell!</p>

(<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; Ha! what are you

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; Nothing, dear!&nbsp;
(<i>Rising</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; Is Austin going to
marry you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; I shall never
marry.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; I thought as
much.&nbsp; You should have come to me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; I know, dear, I
know; but there was nothing to come about.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a
lie.&nbsp; You have disgraced the family.&nbsp; You went to John
Fenwick: see what he has made of it!&nbsp; But I will have you
righted: it shall be atoned in the man&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; Anthony!&nbsp; And
if I had refused him?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; You? refuse George
Austin?&nbsp; You never had the chance.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; I have refused
him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; Dorothy, you
lie.&nbsp; You would shield your lover; but this concerns not you
only: it strikes my honour and my father&rsquo;s honour.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; I have refused
him&mdash;refused him, I tell you&mdash;refused him.&nbsp; The
blame is mine; are you so mad and wicked that you will not
see?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; I see this: that man
must die.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; He? never!&nbsp; You
forget, you forget whom you defy; you run upon your death.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; Ah, my girl, you
should have thought of that before.&nbsp; It is too late now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; Anthony, if I beg
you&mdash;Anthony, I have tried to be a good sister; I brought
you up, dear, nursed you when you were sick, fought for you,
hoped for you, loved you&mdash;think of it, think of the dear
past, think of our home and the happy winter nights, the castles
in the fire, the long shining future, the love that was to
forgive and suffer always&mdash;O you will spare, you will spare
me this.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; I will tell you what
I will do, Dolly: I will do just what you taught me&mdash;my
duty: that, and nothing else.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; O Anthony, you also,
you to strike me!&nbsp; Heavens, shall I kill
them&mdash;I&mdash;I, that love them, kill them!&nbsp; Miserable,
sinful girl!&nbsp; George, George, thank God, you will be far
away!&nbsp; O go, George, go at once!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; He goes the
coward!&nbsp; Ay, is this more of your contrivance?&nbsp; Madam,
you make me blush.&nbsp; But to-day at least I know where I can
find him.&nbsp; This afternoon, on the Pantiles, he must dance
attendance on the Duke of York.&nbsp; Already he must be there;
and there he is at my mercy.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.&nbsp; Thank God, you are
deceived: he will not fight.&nbsp; He promised me that; thank God
I have his promise for that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; Promise!&nbsp; Do
you see this? (<i>producing necklace</i>) the thing he bribed
your maid with?&nbsp; I shall dash it in his teeth before the
Duke and before all Tunbridge.&nbsp; Promise, you poor fool? what
promise holds against a blow?&nbsp; Get to your knees and pray
for him; for, by the God above, if he has any blood in his body,
one of us shall die before to-night.&nbsp; (<i>He goes
out</i>.)</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Miss
Foster</span>, <span class="smcap">Barbara</span>, <span
class="smcap">Menteith</span>; <i>Visitors</i></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span> (<i>entering</i>;
<i>escorted by</i> <span class="smcap">Menteith</span>, <i>and
followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Barbara</span>).&nbsp; And
so, Menteith, here you are once more.&nbsp; And vastly pleased I
am to see you, my good fellow, not only for your own sake, but
because you harbinger the Beau.&nbsp; (<i>Sits</i>, <i>L.</i>;
<span class="smcap">Menteith</span> <i>standing over
her</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Menteith</span>.&nbsp; Honoured madam, I
have had the pleasure to serve Mr. George for more than thirty
years.&nbsp; This is a privilege&mdash;a very great
privilege.&nbsp; I have beheld him in the first societies, moving
among the first rank of personages; and none, madam, none
outshone him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; I assure you, madam,
when Mr. Menteith took me to the play, he talked so much of Mr.
Austin that I couldn&rsquo;t hear a word of Mr. Kean.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; Well, well, and
very right.&nbsp; That was the old school of service, Barbara,
which you would do well to imitate.&nbsp; This is a child,
Menteith, that I am trying to form.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Menteith</span>.&nbsp; Quite so,
madam.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; And are we soon
to see our princely guest, Menteith?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Menteith</span>.&nbsp; His Royal Highness,
madam?&nbsp; I believe I may say quite so.&nbsp; Mr. George will
receive our gallant prince upon the Pantiles (<i>looking at his
watch</i>) in, I should say, a matter of twelve minutes from
now.&nbsp; Such, madam, is Mr. George&rsquo;s order of the
day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; I beg your pardon,
madam, I am sure, but are we really to see one of His
Majesty&rsquo;s own brothers?&nbsp; That will be pure!&nbsp; O
madam, this is better than Carlisle.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; The wood-note
wild: a loyal Cumbrian, Menteith.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Menteith</span>.&nbsp; Eh?&nbsp; Quite so,
madam.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; When she has
seen as much of the Royal Family as you, my good fellow, she will
find it vastly less entertaining.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Menteith</span>.&nbsp; Yes, madam, indeed;
In these distinguished circles, life is but a slavery.&nbsp; None
of the best set would relish Tunbridge without Mr. George;
Tunbridge and Mr. George (if you&rsquo;ll excuse my plainness,
madam) are in a manner of speaking identified; and indeed it was
the Dook&rsquo;s desire alone that brought us here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.&nbsp; What? the
Duke?&nbsp; O dear! was it for that?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Menteith</span>.&nbsp; Though, to be sure,
madam, Mr. George would always be charmed to find himself
(<i>bowing</i>) among so many admired members of his own set.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; Upon my word,
Menteith, Mr. Austin is as fortunate in his servant as his
reputation.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Menteith</span>.&nbsp; Quite so,
madam.&nbsp; But let me observe that the opportunities I have had
of acquiring a knowledge of Mr. George&rsquo;s character have
been positively unrivalled.&nbsp; Nobody knows Mr. George like
his old attendant.&nbsp; The goodness of that
gentleman&mdash;but, madam, you will soon be equally fortunate,
if, as I understand, it is to be a match.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; I hope,
Menteith, you are not taking leave of your senses.&nbsp; Is it
possible you mean my niece?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Menteith</span>.&nbsp; Madam, I have the
honour to congratulate you.&nbsp; I put a second curl in Mr.
George&rsquo;s hair on purpose.</p>
<h4>SCENE II</h4>
<p><i>To these</i>, <span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Menteith</span> <i>falls back</i>, <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Austin</span> <i>takes his place in front
of</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>, <i>his attitude a
counterpart of</i> <span
class="smcap">Menteith&rsquo;s</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Madam, I hasten to
present my homage.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; A truce to
compliments!&nbsp; Menteith, your charming fellow there, has set
me positively crazy.&nbsp; Dear George Austin, is it true? can it
be true?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Madam, if he has been
praising your niece he has been well inspired.&nbsp; If he was
speaking, as I spoke an hour ago myself, I wish, Miss Foster,
that he had held his tongue.&nbsp; I have indeed offered myself
to Miss Dorothy, and she, with the most excellent reason, has
refused me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; Is it possible?
why, my dear George Austin . . . then I suppose it is John
Fenwick after all!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Not one of us is
worthy.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; This is the most
amazing circumstance.&nbsp; You take my breath away.&nbsp; My
niece refuse George Austin? why, I give you my word, I thought
she had adored you.&nbsp; A perfect scandal: it positively must
not get abroad.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Madam, for that young
lady I have a singular regard.&nbsp; Judge me as tenderly as you
can, and set it down, if you must, to an old man&rsquo;s
vanity&mdash;for, Evelina, we are no longer in the heyday of our
youth&mdash;judge me as you will: I should prefer to have it
known.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; Can you?&nbsp;
George Austin, you?&nbsp; My youth was nothing; I was a failure;
but for you? no, George, you never can, you never must be
old.&nbsp; You are the triumph of my generation, George, and of
our old friendship too.&nbsp; Think of my first dance and my
first partner. And to have this story&mdash;no, I could not bear
to have it told of you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Madam, there are some
ladies over whom it is a boast to have prevailed; there are
others whom it is a glory to have loved.&nbsp; And I am so vain,
dear Evelina, that even thus I am proud to link my name with that
of Dorothy Musgrave.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span>.&nbsp; George, you are
changed.&nbsp; I would not know you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; I scarce know
myself.&nbsp; But pardon me, dear friend (<i>taking his
watch</i>), in less than four minutes our illustrious guest will
descend amongst us; and I observe Mr. Fenwick, with whom I have a
pressing business.&nbsp; Suffer me, dear Evelina!&mdash;</p>
<h4>SCENE III</h4>
<p><i>To these</i>, <span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Miss Foster</span> <i>remains seated</i>,
<i>L.</i>&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Austin</span> <i>goes R.
to</i> <span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>, <i>whom he salutes
with great respect</i></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Mr. Fenwick, I have
played and lost.&nbsp; That noble lady, justly incensed at my
misconduct, has condemned me.&nbsp; Under the burden of such a
loss, may I console myself with the esteem of Mr. Fenwick?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; She refused
you?&nbsp; Pardon me, sir, but was the fault not yours?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Perhaps to my shame,
I am no novice, Mr. Fenwick; but I have never felt nor striven as
to-day.&nbsp; I went upon your errand; but, you may trust me,
sir, before I had done I found it was my own.&nbsp; Until to-day
I never rightly valued her; sure, she is fit to be a queen.&nbsp;
I have a remorse here at my heart to which I am a stranger.&nbsp;
Oh! that was a brave life, that was a great heart that I have
ruined.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; Ay, sir, indeed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; But, sir, it is not
to lament the irretrievable that I intrude myself upon your
leisure.&nbsp; There is something to be done, to save, at least
to spare, that lady.&nbsp; You did not fail to observe the
brother?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; No, sir, he knows
all; and being both intemperate and ignorant&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Surely.&nbsp; I
know.&nbsp; I have to ask you then to find what friends you can
among this company; and if you have none, to make them.&nbsp; Let
everybody hear the news.&nbsp; Tell it (if I may offer the
suggestion) with humour: how Mr. Austin, somewhat upon the wane,
but still filled with sufficiency, gloriously presumed and was
most ingloriously set down by a young lady from the north: the
lady&rsquo;s name a secret, which you will permit to be
divined.&nbsp; The laugh&mdash;the position of the
hero&mdash;will make it circulate;&mdash;you perceive I am in
earnest;&mdash;and in this way I believe our young friend will
find himself forestalled.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Fenwick</span>.&nbsp; Mr. Austin, I would
not have dared to ask so much of you; I will go further: were the
positions changed, I should fear to follow your example.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Child, child, you
could not afford it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Dear child, let me
present you to his Royal Highness.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>with
necklace</i>).&nbsp; Mr. Austin, do you recognise the bribe you
gave my sister&rsquo;s maid?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; Hush, sir, hush! you
forget the presence of the Duke.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; Mr. Austin, you are
a coward and a scoundrel.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span>.&nbsp; My child, you will
regret these words: I refuse your quarrel.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>.&nbsp; You do?&nbsp; Take
that.&nbsp; (<i>He strikes</i> <span class="smcap">Austin</span>

<i>Sensation</i>.&nbsp; <i>Music stops</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Tableau</i></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span> (<i>recovering his
composure</i>).&nbsp; Your Royal Highness, suffer me to excuse
the disrespect of this young gentleman.&nbsp; He has so much
apology, and I have, I hope, so good a credit, as incline me to
accept this blow.&nbsp; But I must beg of your Highness, and,
gentlemen, all of you here present, to bear with me while I will
explain what is too capable of misconstruction.&nbsp; I am the
rejected suitor of this young gentleman&rsquo;s sister; of Miss
Dorothy Musgrave: a lady whom I singularly honour and esteem; a
word from whom (if I could hope that word) would fill my life
with happiness.&nbsp; I was not worthy of that lady; when I was
defeated in fair field, I presumed to make advances through her
maid.&nbsp; See in how laughable a manner fate repaid me!&nbsp;
The waiting-girl derided, the mistress denied, and now comes in
this very ardent champion who publicly insults me.&nbsp; My
vanity is cured; you will judge it right, I am persuaded, all of
you, that I should accept my proper punishment in silence; you,
my Lord Duke, to pardon this young gentleman; and you, Mr.
Musgrave, to spare me further provocation, which I am determined
to ignore.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy</span> (<i>rushing forward</i>,
<i>falling at</i> <span class="smcap">Austin&rsquo;s</span>
<i>knees</i>, <i>and seizing his hand</i>).&nbsp; George, George,
it was for me.&nbsp; My hero! take me!&nbsp; What you will!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Austin</span> (<i>in an agony</i>).&nbsp;
My dear creature, remember that we are in public.&nbsp;
(<i>Raising her</i>.)&nbsp; Your Royal Highness, may I present
you Mrs. George Frederick Austin?&nbsp; (<i>The Curtain falls on

<h3>ACT I.</h3>
<p><i>The Stage represents a room in the Admiral Guinea&rsquo;s
house</i>: <i>fireplace</i>, <i>arm-chair</i>, <i>and table with
Bible</i>, <i>L.</i>, <i>towards the front</i>; <i>door C.</i>,
<i>with window on each side</i>, <i>the window on the R.</i>,
<i>practicable</i>; <i>doors</i>, <i>R. and L.</i>, <i>back</i>;
<i>corner cupboard</i>, <i>a brass-strapped sea-chest fixed to
the wall and floor</i>, <i>R.</i>; <i>cutlasses</i>,
<i>telescopes</i>, <i>sextant</i>, <i>quadrant</i>, <i>a
calendar</i>, <i>and several maps upon the wall</i>; <i>a ship
clock</i>; <i>three wooden chairs</i>; <i>a dresser against
wall</i>, <i>R. C.</i>; <i>on the chimney-piece the model of a
brig and several shells</i>.&nbsp; <i>The centre bare of
furniture</i>.&nbsp; <i>Through the widows and the door</i>,
<i>which is open</i>, <i>green trees and a small field of
sea</i>.</p>
<h4>SCENE I</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>
<i>is discovered</i>, <i>dusting</i></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Ten months and a
week to-day!&nbsp; Now for a new mark.&nbsp; Since the last, the
sun has set and risen over the fields and the pleasant trees at
home, and on Kit&rsquo;s lone ship and the empty sea.&nbsp;
Perhaps it blew; perhaps rained; (<i>at the chart</i>) perhaps he
was far up here to the nor&rsquo;ard, where the icebergs sail;
perhaps at anchor among these wild islands of the snakes and
buccaneers.&nbsp; O, you big chart, if I could see him sailing on
you!&nbsp; North and South Atlantic; such a weary sight of water
and no land; never an island for the poor lad to land upon.&nbsp;
But still, God&rsquo;s there.&nbsp; (<i>She takes down the
telescope to dust it</i>.)&nbsp; Father&rsquo;s spy-glass again;
and my poor Kit perhaps with such another, sweeping the great
deep!</p>
<h4>SCENE II</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Arethusa</span>; <i>to her</i>, <span
class="smcap">Kit</span>, <i>C.</i>&nbsp; [<i>He enters on
tiptoe</i>, <i>and she does not see or hear him</i>]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span> (<i>dusting
telescope</i>).&nbsp; At sea they have less dust at least:
that&rsquo;s so much comfort.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Sweetheart, ahoy!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Kit!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Arethusa.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; My Kit!&nbsp; Home
again&mdash;O my love!&mdash;home again to me!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; As straight as wind and
tide could carry me!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; O Kit, my
dearest.&nbsp; O Kit&mdash;O! O!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Hey?&nbsp; Steady, lass:
steady, I say.&nbsp; For goodness&rsquo; sake, ease it off.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; I will, Kit&mdash;I
will.&nbsp; But you came so sudden.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; I thought ten months of
it about preparation enough.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Ten months and a
week: you haven&rsquo;t counted the days as I have.&nbsp; Another
day gone, and one day nearer to Kit: that has been my
almanac.&nbsp; How brown you are! how handsome!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; A pity you can&rsquo;t
see yourself!&nbsp; Well, no, I&rsquo;ll never be handsome: brown
I may be, never handsome.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m better than that,
if the proverb&rsquo;s true; for I&rsquo;m ten hundred thousand
fathoms deep in love.&nbsp; I bring you a faithful sailor.&nbsp;
What! you don&rsquo;t think much of that for a curiosity?&nbsp;
Well, that&rsquo;s so: you&rsquo;re right; the rarity is in the
girl that&rsquo;s worth it ten times over.&nbsp; Faithful?&nbsp;
I couldn&rsquo;t help it if I tried!&nbsp; No, sweetheart, and I
fear nothing: I don&rsquo;t know what fear is, but just of losing
you.&nbsp; (<i>Starting</i>.)&nbsp; Lord, that&rsquo;s not the
Admiral?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Aha, Mr.
Dreadnought! you see you fear my father.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; That I do.&nbsp; But,
thank goodness, it&rsquo;s nobody.&nbsp; Kiss me: no, I
won&rsquo;t kiss you: kiss <i>me</i>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give you a
present for that.&nbsp; See!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; A wedding-ring!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; My mother&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Will you take it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Yes, will
I&mdash;and give myself for it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Ah, if we could only
count upon your father!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a man every inch of him;
but he can&rsquo;t endure Kit French.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; He hasn&rsquo;t
learned to know you, Kit, as I have, nor yet do you know
him.&nbsp; He seems hard and violent; at heart he is only a man
overwhelmed with sorrow.&nbsp; Why else, when he looks at me and
does not know that I observe him, should his face change, and
fill with such tenderness, that I could weep to see him?&nbsp;
Why, when he walks in his sleep, as he does almost every night,
his eyes open and beholding nothing, why should he cry so
pitifully on my mother&rsquo;s name?&nbsp; Ah, if you could hear
him then, you would say yourself: here is a man that has loved;
here is a man that will be kind to lovers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Is that so?&nbsp; Ay,
it&rsquo;s a hard thing to lose your wife; ay, that must cut the
heart indeed.&nbsp; But for all that, my lass, your father is
keen for the doubloons.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Right, Kit: and
small blame to him.&nbsp; There is only one way to be honest, and
the name of that is thrift.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Well, and that&rsquo;s
my motto.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve left the ship; no more letter of
marque for me.&nbsp; Good-bye to Kit French,
privateersman&rsquo;s mate; and how-d&rsquo;ye-do to Christopher,
the coasting skipper.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen the very boat for me:
I&rsquo;ve enough to buy her, too; and to furnish a good house,
and keep a shot in the locker for bad luck.&nbsp; So far,
there&rsquo;s nothing to gainsay.&nbsp; So far it&rsquo;s hopeful
enough; but still there&rsquo;s Admiral Guinea, you
know&mdash;and the plain truth is that I&rsquo;m afraid of
him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Admiral
Guinea?&nbsp; Now Kit, if you are to be true lover of mine, you
shall not use that name.&nbsp; His name is Captain Gaunt.&nbsp;
As for fearing him, Kit French, you&rsquo;re not the man for me,
if you fear anything but sin.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a stern man
because he&rsquo;s in the right.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; He is a man of God; I am
what he calls a child of perdition.&nbsp; I was a
privateersman&mdash;serving my country, I say; but he calls it
pirate.&nbsp; He is thrifty and sober; he has a treasure, they
say, and it lies so near his heart that he tumbles up in his
sleep to stand watch over it.&nbsp; What has a harum-scarum dog
like me to expect from a man like him?&nbsp; He won&rsquo;t see
I&rsquo;m starving for a chance to mend; &lsquo;Mend,&rsquo;
he&rsquo;ll say; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be shot if you mend at the
expense of my daughter;&rsquo; and the worst of it is, you see,
he&rsquo;ll be right.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Kit, if you dare to
say that faint-hearted word again, I&rsquo;ll take my ring
off.&nbsp; What are we here for but to grow better or grow
worse?&nbsp; Do you think Arethusa French will be the same as
Arethusa Gaunt?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want her
better.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Ah, but she shall
be!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Hark, here he is!&nbsp;
By George, it&rsquo;s neck or nothing now.&nbsp; Stand by to back
me up.</p>
<h4>SCENE III</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>To these</i>, <span
class="smcap">Gaunt</span>, <i>C.</i></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span> (<i>with</i> <span
class="smcap">Arethusa&rsquo;s</span> <i>hand</i>).&nbsp; Captain
Gaunt, I have come to ask you for your daughter.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; Hum.&nbsp; (<i>He sits
in his chair</i>, <i>L.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; I love her, and she
loves me, sir.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve left the privateering.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve enough to set me up and buy a tidy sloop&mdash;Jack
Lee&rsquo;s; you know the boat, Captain; clinker built, not four
years old, eighty tons burthen, steers like a child.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve put my mother&rsquo;s ring on Arethusa&rsquo;s finger;
and if you&rsquo;ll give us your blessing, I&rsquo;ll engage to
turn over a new leaf, and make her a good husband.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; In whose strength,
Christopher French?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; In the strength of my
good, honest love for her: as you did for her mother, and my
father for mine.&nbsp; And you know, Captain, a man can&rsquo;t
command the wind; but (excuse me, sir) he can always lie the best
course possible, and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do, so God help
me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; Arethusa, you at least
are the child of many prayers; your eyes have been unsealed; and
to you the world stands naked, a morning watch for duration, a
thing spun of cobwebs for solidity.&nbsp; In the presence of an
angry God, I ask you: have you heard this man?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Father, I know Kit,
and I love him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; I say it solemnly,
this is no Christian union.&nbsp; To you, Christopher French, I
will speak nothing of eternal truths: I will speak to you the
language of this world.&nbsp; You have been trained among sinners
who gloried in their sin: in your whole life you never saved one
farthing; and now, when your pockets are full, you think you can
begin, poor dupe, in your own strength.&nbsp; You are a
roysterer, a jovial companion; you mean no harm&mdash;you are
nobody&rsquo;s enemy but your own.&nbsp; No doubt you tell this
girl of mine, and no doubt you tell yourself, that you can
change.&nbsp; Christopher, speaking under correction, I defy
you!&nbsp; You ask me for this child of many supplications, for
this brand plucked from the burning: I look at you; I read you
through and through; and I tell you&mdash;no!&nbsp; (<i>Striking
table with his fist</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Captain Gaunt, if you
mean that I am not worthy of her, I&rsquo;m the first to say
so.&nbsp; But, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, sir, I&rsquo;m a young
man, and young men are no better&rsquo;n they ought to be;
it&rsquo;s known; they&rsquo;re all like that; and what&rsquo;s
their chance?&nbsp; To be married to a girl like this!&nbsp; And
would you refuse it to me?&nbsp; Why, sir, you yourself, when you
came courting, you were young and rough; and yet I&rsquo;ll make
bold to say that Mrs. Gaunt was a happy woman, and the saving of
yourself into the bargain.&nbsp; Well, now, Captain Gaunt, will
you deny another man, and that man a sailor, the very salvation
that you had yourself?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; Salvation, Christopher
French, is from above.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Well, sir, that is so;
but there&rsquo;s means, too; and what means so strong as the
wife a man has to strive and toil for, and that bears the
punishment whenever he goes wrong?&nbsp; Now, sir, I&rsquo;ve
spoke with your old shipmates in the Guinea trade.&nbsp; Hard as
nails, they said, and true as the compass: as rough as a slaver,
but as just as a judge.&nbsp; Well, sir, you hear me plead: I ask
you for my chance; don&rsquo;t you deny it to me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; You speak of me?&nbsp;
In the true balances we both weigh nothing.&nbsp; But two things
I know: the depth of iniquity, how foul it is; and the agony with
which a man repents.&nbsp; Not until seven devils were cast out
of me did I awake; each rent me as it passed.&nbsp; Ay, that was
repentance.&nbsp; Christopher, Christopher, you have sailed
before the wind since first you weighed your anchor, and now you
think to sail upon a bowline?&nbsp; You do not know your ship,
young man: you will go to le&rsquo;ward like a sheet of paper; I
tell you so that know&mdash;I tell you so that have tried, and
failed, and wrestled in the sweat of prayer, and at last, at
last, have tasted grace.&nbsp; But, meanwhile, no flesh and blood
of mine shall lie at the mercy of such a wretch as I was then, or
as you are this day.&nbsp; I could not own the deed before the
face of heaven if I sanctioned this unequal yoke.&nbsp; Arethusa,
pluck off that ring from off your finger.&nbsp; Christopher
French, take it, and go hence.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Arethusa, what do you
say?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; O Kit, you know my
heart.&nbsp; But he is alone, and I am his only comfort; and I
owe all to him; and shall I not obey my father?&nbsp; But, Kit,
if you will let me, I will keep your ring.&nbsp; Go, Kit; go, and
prove to my father that he was mistaken; go and win me.&nbsp; And
O, Kit, if ever you should weary, come to me&mdash;no, do not
come! but send a word&mdash;and I shall know all, and you shall
have your ring.&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">Gaunt</span> <i>opens
his Bible and begins to read</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t say that,
don&rsquo;t say such things to me; I sink or swim with you.&nbsp;
(<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.)&nbsp; Old man,
you&rsquo;ve struck me hard; give me a good word to go
with.&nbsp; Name your time; I&rsquo;ll stand the test.&nbsp; Give
me a spark of hope, and I&rsquo;ll fight through for it.&nbsp;
Say just this&mdash;&lsquo;Prove I was mistaken,&rsquo; and by
George, I&rsquo;ll prove it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span> (<i>looking up</i>).&nbsp; I
make no such compacts.&nbsp; Go, and swear not at all.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Go, Kit!&nbsp; I
keep the ring.</p>
<h4>SCENE IV</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Arethusa</span>, <span
class="smcap">Gaunt</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Father, what have
we done that you should be so cruel?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span> (<i>laying down Bible</i>,
<i>and rising</i>).&nbsp; Do you call me cruel?&nbsp; You speak
after the flesh.&nbsp; I have done you this day a service that
you will live to bless me for upon your knees.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; He loves me, and I
love him: you can never alter that; do what you will, father,
that can never change.&nbsp; I love him, I believe in him, I will
be true to him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; Arethusa, you are the
sole thing death has left me on this earth; and I must watch over
your carnal happiness and your eternal weal.&nbsp; You do not
know what this implies to me.&nbsp; Your mother&mdash;my
Hester&mdash;tongue cannot tell, nor heart conceive the pangs she
suffered.&nbsp; If it lies in me, your life shall not be lost on
that same reef of an ungodly husband.&nbsp; (<i>Goes out</i>,
<i>C.</i>)</p>
<h4>SCENE V</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Arethusa</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; I thought the time
dragged long and weary when I knew that Kit was homeward bound,
all the white sails a-blowing out towards England, and my
Kit&rsquo;s face turned this way?&nbsp; (<i>She begins to
dust</i>.)&nbsp; Sure, if my mother were here, she would
understand and help us; she would understand a young maid&rsquo;s
heart, though her own had never an ache; and she would love my
Kit.&nbsp; (<i>Putting back the telescope</i>.)&nbsp; To think
she died: husband and child&mdash;and so much love&mdash;she was
taken from them all.&nbsp; Ah, there is no parting but the
grave!&nbsp; And Kit and I both live, and both love each other;
and here am I cast down?&nbsp; O, Arethusa, shame!&nbsp; And your
love home from the deep seas, and loving you still; and the sun
shining; and the world all full of hope?&nbsp; O, hope,
you&rsquo;re a good word!</p>
<h4>SCENE VI</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Gaunt</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>; <i>to her</i>, <span

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For it&rsquo;s time for us to
go.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Who comes here? a
seaman by his song, and father out!&nbsp; (<i>She tries the
air</i>)&nbsp; &lsquo;Time for us to go!&rsquo;&nbsp; It sounds a
wild kind of song.&nbsp; (<i>Tap-tap</i>; <span
class="smcap">Pew</span> <i>passes the window</i>.)&nbsp; O, what
a face&mdash;and blind!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span> (<i>entering</i>).&nbsp; Kind
Christian friends, take pity on a poor blind mariner, as lost his
precious sight in the defence of his native country, England, and
God bless King George!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; What can I do for
you, sailor?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Good Christian lady,
help a poor blind mariner to a mouthful of meat.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
served His Majesty in every quarter of the globe; I&rsquo;ve
spoke with &rsquo;Awke and glorious Anson, as I might with you;
and I&rsquo;ve tramped it all night long, upon my sinful feet,
and with a empty belly.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; You shall not ask
bread and be denied by a sailor&rsquo;s daughter and a
sailor&rsquo;s sweetheart; and when my father returns he shall
give you something to set you on your road.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Kind and lovely lady, do
you tell me that you are in a manner of speaking alone? or do my
ears deceive a poor blind seaman?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; I live here with my
father, and my father is abroad.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Dear, beautiful,
Christian lady, tell a poor blind man your honoured name, that he
may remember it in his poor blind prayers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Sailor, I am
Arethusa Gaunt.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Sweet lady, answer a
poor blind man one other question: are you in a manner of
speaking related to Cap&rsquo;n John Gaunt?&nbsp; Cap&rsquo;n
John as in the ebony trade were known as Admiral Guinea?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Captain John Gaunt
is my father.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span> (<i>dropping the blind
man&rsquo;s whine</i>).&nbsp; Lord, think of that now!&nbsp; They
told me this was where he lived, and so it is.&nbsp; And
here&rsquo;s old Pew, old David Pew, as was the Admiral&rsquo;s
own bo&rsquo;sun, colloguing in his old commander&rsquo;s
parlour, with his old commander&rsquo;s gal (<i>seizes</i> <span
class="smcap">Arethusa</span>).&nbsp; Ah, and a bouncer you are,
and no mistake.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Let me go! how dare
you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Lord love you,
don&rsquo;t you struggle, now, don&rsquo;t you.&nbsp; (<i>She
escapes into front R. corner</i>, <i>where he keeps her
imprisoned</i>.)&nbsp; Ah, well, we&rsquo;ll get you again, my
lovely woman.&nbsp; What a arm you&rsquo;ve got&mdash;great god
of love&mdash;and a face like a peach!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a judge, I
am.&nbsp; (<i>She tries to escape; he stops her</i>.)&nbsp; No,
you don&rsquo;t; O, I can hear a flea jump!&nbsp; [But it&rsquo;s
here where I miss my deadlights.&nbsp; Poor old Pew; him as the
ladies always would have for their fancy man and take no denial;

eyes.&nbsp; (<i>Singing</i>)&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Be they black like

Or be they blue like to the sky.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Black like the Admiral&rsquo;s? or blue like his poor dear
wife&rsquo;s?&nbsp; Ah, I was fond of that there woman, I was:
the Admiral was jealous of me.]&nbsp; Arethusa, my dear,&mdash;my
heart, what a &rsquo;and and arm you <i>have</i> got; I&rsquo;ll
dream o&rsquo; that &rsquo;and and arm, I will!&mdash;but as I
was a-saying, does the Admiral ever in a manner of speaking refer
to his old bo&rsquo;sun David Pew? him as he fell out with about
the black woman at Lagos, and almost slashed the shoulder off of
him one morning before breakfast?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; You leave this
house.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Hey? (<i>he crosses and
seizes her again</i>)&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you fight, my lovely one:
now don&rsquo;t make old blind Pew forget his manners before a
female.&nbsp; What! you will?&nbsp; Stop that, or I&rsquo;ll have
the arm right out of your body.&nbsp; (<i>He gives her arm a
wrench</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; O! help, help!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Stash your patter, damn
you.&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">Arethusa</span> <i>gives
in</i>.)&nbsp; Ah, I thought it: Pew&rsquo;s way, Pew&rsquo;s
way.&nbsp; Now, look you here, my lovely woman.&nbsp; If you
sling in another word that isn&rsquo;t in answer to my questions,
I&rsquo;ll pull your j&rsquo;ints out one by one.&nbsp;
Where&rsquo;s the Commander?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; I have said: he is
abroad.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; When&rsquo;s he coming
aboard again?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; At any moment.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Does he keep his
strength?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll see
when he returns.&nbsp; (<i>He wrenches her arm again</i>.)&nbsp;
Ah!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Is he still on
piety?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; O, he is a
Christian man!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; A Christian man, is
he?&nbsp; Where does he keep his rum?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Nay, you shall
steal nothing by my help.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; No more I shall
(<i>becoming amorous</i>).&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a lovely woman,
that&rsquo;s what you are; how would you like old Pew for a
sweetheart, hey?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s blind, is Pew, but strong as a
lion; and the sex is his &rsquo;ole delight.&nbsp; Ah, them
beautiful, beautiful lips!&nbsp; A kiss!&nbsp; Come!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Leave go, leave
go!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Hey? you would?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp; (<i>She
thrusts him down</i>, <i>and escapes to door</i>, <i>R.</i>)</p>
<h4>SCENE VII</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span> (<i>picking himself
up</i>).&nbsp; Ah, she&rsquo;s a bouncer, she is!&nbsp;
Where&rsquo;s my stick?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the sort of female for
David Pew.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t she fight? and didn&rsquo;t she

her?&nbsp; Pew&rsquo;s way with &rsquo;em all: the prettier they
was, the uglier he were to &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Pew&rsquo;s way: a
way he had with him; and a damned good way too.&nbsp; (<i>Listens
at L. door</i>.)&nbsp; That&rsquo;s her bedroom, I reckon; and
she&rsquo;s double-locked herself in.&nbsp; Good again:
it&rsquo;s a crying mercy the Admiral didn&rsquo;t come in.&nbsp;
But you always loses your &rsquo;ed, Pew, with a female:
that&rsquo;s what charms &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Now for business.&nbsp;
The front door.&nbsp; No bar; only a big lock (<i>trying keys
from his pocket</i>).&nbsp; Key one; no go.&nbsp; Key two; no
go.&nbsp; Key three; ah, that does it.&nbsp; Ah! (<i>feeling
key</i>) him with the three wards and the little &rsquo;un: good
again!&nbsp; Now if I could only find a mate in this rotten
country &rsquo;amlick: one to be eyes to me; I can steer, but I
can&rsquo;t conn myself, worse luck!&nbsp; If I could only find a
mate!&nbsp; And to-night, about three bells in the middle watch,
old Pew will take a little cruise, and lay aboard his ancient
friend the Admiral; or, barring that, the Admiral&rsquo;s old
sea-chest&mdash;the chest he kept the shiners in aboard the
brig.&nbsp; Where is it, I wonder? in his berth, or in the cabin
here?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s big enough, and the brass bands is plain
to feel by.&nbsp; (<i>Searching about with stick</i>.)&nbsp;

Chair (<i>his stick just avoids the chest</i>).&nbsp; No
sea-chest.&nbsp; I must have a mate to see for me, to see for old
Pew: him as had eyes like a eagle!&nbsp; Meanwhile, rum.&nbsp;

<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Pew</span>; to
him <span class="smcap">Gaunt</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; What brings you
here?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Cap&rsquo;n, do my ears
deceive me? or is this my old commander?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; My name is John
Gaunt.&nbsp; Who are you, my man, and what&rsquo;s your
business?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s the facks,
so help me.&nbsp; A lovely female in this house was Christian
enough to pity the poor blind; and lo and belold! who should she
turn out to be but my old commander&rsquo;s daughter!&nbsp;
&lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; says I to her, &lsquo;I was the
Admiral&rsquo;s own particular
bo&rsquo;sun.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;La, sailor,&rsquo; she says to
me, &lsquo;how glad he&rsquo;ll be to see
you!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;won&rsquo;t he
just&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go
and fetch him,&rsquo; she says; &lsquo;you make yourself at
&rsquo;ome.&rsquo;&nbsp; And off she went; and, Commander, here I
am.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span> (<i>sitting down</i>).&nbsp;
Well?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Well, Cap&rsquo;n?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; What do you want?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Well, Admiral, in a
general way, what I want in a manner of speaking is money and
rum.&nbsp; (<i>A pause</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; David Pew, I have
known you a long time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; And so you have; aboard
the old <i>Arethusa</i>; and you don&rsquo;t seem that cheered up
as I&rsquo;d looked for, with an old shipmate dropping in, one as
has been seeking you two years and more&mdash;and blind at
that.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you remember the old chantie?&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Time
for us to go,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time for us to go,<br />
And when we&rsquo;d clapped the hatches on,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas time for us to go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a note you had to sing, what a swaller for a pannikin of
rum, and what a fist for the shiners!&nbsp; Ah, Cap&rsquo;n, they
didn&rsquo;t call you Admiral Guinea for nothing.&nbsp; I can see
that old sea-chest of yours&mdash;her with the brass bands, where
you kept your gold dust and doubloons: you know!&mdash;I can see
her as well this minute as though you and me was still at it
playing p&ucirc;t on the lid of her . . .&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t
say nothing, Cap&rsquo;n?&nbsp; . . .&nbsp; Well, here it is: I
want money and I want rum.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know what it is
to want rum, you don&rsquo;t: it gets to that p&rsquo;int, that
you would kill a &rsquo;ole ship&rsquo;s company for just one
guttle of it.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Admiral Guinea, my old Commander,
go back on poor old Pew? and him high and dry?&nbsp; [Not
you!&nbsp; When we had words over the negro lass at Lagos, what
did you do? fair dealings was your word: fair as between man and
man; and we had it out with p&rsquo;int and edge on Lagos
sands.&nbsp; And you&rsquo;re not going back on your word to me,
now I&rsquo;m old and blind?&nbsp; No, no! belay that, I
say.&nbsp; Give me the old motto: Fair dealings, as between man
and man.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; David Pew, it were
better for you that you were sunk in fifty fathom.&nbsp; I know
your life; and first and last, it is one broadside of
wickedness.&nbsp; You were a porter in a school, and beat a boy
to death; you ran for it, turned slaver, and shipped with me, a
green hand.&nbsp; Ay, that was the craft for you: that was the
right craft, and I was the right captain; there was none worse
that sailed to Guinea.&nbsp; Well, what came of that?&nbsp; In
five years&rsquo; time you made yourself the terror and
abhorrence of your messmates.&nbsp; The worst hands detested you;
your captain&mdash;that was me, John Gaunt, the chief of
sinners&mdash;cast you out for a Jonah.&nbsp; [Who was it stabbed
the Portuguese and made off inland with his miserable wife?&nbsp;
Who, raging drunk on rum, clapped fire to the baracoons and
burned the poor soulless creatures in their chains?]&nbsp; Ay,
you were a scandal to the Guinea coast, from Lagos down to
Calabar? and when at last I sent you ashore, a marooned
man&mdash;your shipmates, devils as they were, cheering and
rejoicing to be quit of you&mdash;by heaven, it was a ton&rsquo;s
weight off the brig!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Cap&rsquo;n Gaunt,
Cap&rsquo;n Gaunt, these are ugly words.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; What next?&nbsp; You
shipped with Flint the Pirate.&nbsp; What you did then I know
not; the deep seas have kept the secret: kept it, ay, and will
keep against the Great Day.&nbsp; God smote you with blindness,
but you heeded not the sign.&nbsp; That was His last mercy; look
for no more.&nbsp; To your knees, man, and repent!&nbsp; Pray for
a new heart; flush out your sins with tears; flee while you may
from the terrors of the wrath to come.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Now, I want this clear:
Do I understand that you&rsquo;re going back on me, and
you&rsquo;ll see me damned first?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; Of me you shall have
neither money nor strong drink: not a guinea to spend in riot;
not a drop to fire your heart with devilry.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Cap&rsquo;n, do you
think it wise to quarrel with me?&nbsp; I put it to you now,
Cap&rsquo;n, fairly, as between man and man&mdash;do you think it
wise?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; I fear nothing.&nbsp;
My feet are on the Rock.&nbsp; Begone!&nbsp; (<i>He opens the
Bible and begins to read</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span> (<i>after a pause</i>).&nbsp;
Well, Cap&rsquo;n, you know best, no doubt; and David Pew&rsquo;s
about the last man, though I says it, to up and thwart an old
Commander.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve been &rsquo;ard on David Pew,
Cap&rsquo;n: &rsquo;ard on the poor blind; but you&rsquo;ll live
to regret it&mdash;ah, my Christian friend, you&rsquo;ll live to
eat them words up.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s no malice here: that
ain&rsquo;t Pew&rsquo;s way; here&rsquo;s a sailor&rsquo;s hand
upon it . . . You don&rsquo;t say nothing?&nbsp; (<span
class="smcap">Gaunt</span> <i>turns a page</i>.)&nbsp; Ah,
reading, was you?&nbsp; Reading, by thunder!&nbsp; Well,
here&rsquo;s my respecks (<i>singing</i>)&mdash;</p>

ain&rsquo;t but the bones of the man he used to be.&nbsp; Bear
away for the New Jerusalem, and this is what you run aground on,
is it?&nbsp; Good again; but it ain&rsquo;t Pew&rsquo;s way;
Pew&rsquo;s way is rum.&mdash;Sanded floor.&nbsp; Rum is his

not enough of it to wet your eye; damn all greediness, I
say.&nbsp; Pot (<i>drinks</i>), small beer&mdash;a drink that I
ab&rsquo;or like bilge!&nbsp; What I want is rum.&nbsp;
(<i>Calling</i>, <i>and rapping with stick on table</i>.)&nbsp;
Halloa, there!&nbsp; House, ahoy!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span> (<i>without</i>).&nbsp;
Coming, sir, coming.&nbsp; (<i>She enters</i>, <i>R.</i>)&nbsp;
What can I do&mdash;? (<i>Seeing</i> <span

beggar-man, what&rsquo;s for you?</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Rum, ma&rsquo;am, rum;
and a bit o&rsquo; supper.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>.&nbsp; And a bed to

<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; <i>And</i> a bed to
follow: <i>if</i> you please.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>.&nbsp; This is the
&lsquo;<i>Admiral Benbow</i>,&rsquo; a respectable house, and
receives none but decent company; and I&rsquo;ll ask you to go
somewhere else, for I don&rsquo;t like the looks of you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Turn me away?&nbsp; Why,
Lord love you, I&rsquo;m David Pew&mdash;old David Pew&mdash;him
as was Benbow&rsquo;s own particular cox&rsquo;n.&nbsp; You
wouldn&rsquo;t turn away old Pew from the sign of his late
commander&rsquo;s &rsquo;ed?&nbsp; Ah, my British female,
you&rsquo;d have used me different if you&rsquo;d seen me in the
fight!&nbsp; [There laid old Benbow, both his legs shot off, in a
basket, and the blessed spy-glass at his eye to that same hour: a
picter, ma&rsquo;am, of naval daring: when a round shot come, and
took and knocked a bucketful of shivers right into my poor
daylights.&nbsp; &lsquo;Damme,&rsquo; says the Admiral, &lsquo;is
that old Pew, <i>my</i> old Pew?&rsquo; he
says.&mdash;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s old Pew, sir,&rsquo; says the first
lootenant, &lsquo;worse luck,&rsquo; he says.&mdash;&lsquo;Then
damme,&rsquo; says Admiral Benbow, &lsquo;if that&rsquo;s how
they serve a lion-&rsquo;arted seaman, damme if I care to
live,&rsquo; he says; and, ma&rsquo;am, he laid down his
spy-glass.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>.&nbsp; Blind man, I
don&rsquo;t fancy you, and that&rsquo;s the truth; and I&rsquo;ll
thank you to take yourself off.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Thirty years have I
fought for country and king, and now in my blind old age
I&rsquo;m to be sent packing from a measly
public-&rsquo;ouse?&nbsp; Mark ye, ma&rsquo;am, if I go, you take
the consequences.&nbsp; Is this a inn?&nbsp; Or haint it?&nbsp;
If it is a inn, then by act of parleyment, I&rsquo;m free to
sling my &rsquo;ammick.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you forget: this is a
act of parleyment job, this is.&nbsp; You look out.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>.&nbsp; Why, what&rsquo;s
to do with the man and his acts of parliament?&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t want to fly in the face of an act of parliament, not
I.&nbsp; If what you say is true&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; True?&nbsp; If
there&rsquo;s anything truer than a act of parleyment&mdash;Ah!
you ask the beak.&nbsp; True?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve that in my
&rsquo;art as makes me wish it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
like to risk it.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like your looks, and
you&rsquo;re more sea-lawyer than seaman to my mind.&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;ll tell you what: if you can pay, you can stay.&nbsp; So
there.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; No chink, no
drink?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s your motto, is it?&nbsp; Well,
that&rsquo;s sense.&nbsp; Now, look here, ma&rsquo;am, I
ain&rsquo;t beautiful like you; but I&rsquo;m good, and
I&rsquo;ll give you warrant for it.&nbsp; Get me a noggin of rum,
and suthin&rsquo; to scoff, and a penny pipe, and a half-a-foot
of baccy; and there&rsquo;s a guinea for the reckoning.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s plenty more in the locker; so bear a hand, and be
smart.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like waiting; it ain&rsquo;t my
way.&nbsp; (<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>,

<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span> (<i>drinks</i>).&nbsp; Ah,
rum!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my sheet-anchor: rum and the blessed
Gospel.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you forget that, ma&rsquo;am: rum and
the Gospel is old Pew&rsquo;s sheet-anchor.&nbsp; You can take
for another while you&rsquo;re about it; and, I say, short
reckonings make long friends, hey?&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s my
change?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
counting it now.&nbsp; There, there it is, and thank you for your
custom.&nbsp; (<i>She goes out</i>, <i>R.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span> (<i>calling after
her</i>).&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t thank me, ma&rsquo;am; thank the act
of parleyment!&nbsp; Rum, fourpence; two penny pieces and a
Willi&rsquo;m-and-Mary tizzy makes a shilling; and a spade
half-guinea is eleven and six (<i>re-enter</i> <span
class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span> <i>with supper</i>, <i>pipe</i>,
<i>etc.</i>); and a blessed majesty George the First crown-piece
makes sixteen and six; and two shilling bits is eighteen and six;
and a new half-crown makes&mdash;no it don&rsquo;t!&nbsp; O,
no!&nbsp; Old Pew&rsquo;s too smart a hand to be bammed with a
soft half-tusheroon.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span> (<i>changing
piece</i>).&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I didn&rsquo;t know it,
sailor.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span> (<i>trying new coin between his
teeth</i>).&nbsp; In course you didn&rsquo;t, my dear; but I did,
and I thought I&rsquo;d mention it.&nbsp; Is that my supper,
hey?&nbsp; Do my nose deceive me?&nbsp; (<i>Sniffing and
feeling</i>.)&nbsp; Cold duck? sage and onions? a round of double
Gloster? and that noggin o&rsquo; rum?&nbsp; Why, I declare if
I&rsquo;d stayed and took pot-luck with my old commander,
Cap&rsquo;n John Gaunt, he couldn&rsquo;t have beat this little
spread, as I&rsquo;ve got by act of parleyment.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span> (<i>at
knitting</i>).&nbsp; Do you know the captain, sailor?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Know him?&nbsp; I was
that man&rsquo;s bos&rsquo;un, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; In the Guinea
trade, we was known as &lsquo;Pew&rsquo;s Cap&rsquo;n,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Gaunt&rsquo;s Bo&rsquo;sun,&rsquo; one for other
like.&nbsp; We was like two brothers, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; And a
excellent cold duck, to be sure; and the rum lovely.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>.&nbsp; If you know John
Gaunt, you know his daughter Arethusa.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; What?&nbsp;
Arethusa?&nbsp; Know her, says you? know her?&nbsp; Why, Lord
love you, I was her god-father.&nbsp; [&lsquo;Pew,&rsquo; says
Jack Gaunt to me, &lsquo;Pew,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re
a man,&rsquo; he says; &lsquo;I like a man to be a man,&rsquo;
says he, &lsquo;and damme,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;I like
<i>you</i>; and sink me,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;if you
don&rsquo;t promise and vow in the name of that new-born
babe,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;why damme, Pew,&rsquo; says he,
&lsquo;you&rsquo;re not the man I take you for.&rsquo;]&nbsp;
Yes, ma&rsquo;am, I named that female; with my own &rsquo;ands I
did; Arethusa, I named her; that was the name I give her; so now
you know if I speak true.&nbsp; And if you&rsquo;ll be as good as
get me another noggin of rum, why, we&rsquo;ll drink her
&rsquo;elth with three times three.&nbsp; (<i>Exit</i> <span
class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>: <span class="smcap">Pew</span>
<i>eating</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>
<i>re-entering with rum</i>.)</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>.&nbsp; If what you say
be true, sailor (and I don&rsquo;t say it isn&rsquo;t, mind!),
it&rsquo;s strange that Arethusa and that godly man her father
have never so much as spoke your name.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Why, that&rsquo;s
so!&nbsp; And why, says you?&nbsp; Why, when I dropped in and
paid my respecks this morning, do you think she knew me?&nbsp; No
more&rsquo;n a babe unborn!&nbsp; Why, ma&rsquo;am, when I
promised and vowed for her, I was the picter of a
man-o&rsquo;-war&rsquo;s man, I was: eye like a eagle; walked the
deck in a hornpipe, foot up and foot down; v&rsquo;ice as mellow
as rum; &rsquo;and upon &rsquo;art, and all the females took dead
aback at the first sight, Lord bless &rsquo;em!&nbsp; Know
me?&nbsp; Not likely.&nbsp; And as for me, when I found her such
a lovely woman&mdash;by the feel of her &rsquo;and and
arm!&mdash;you might have knocked me down with a feather.&nbsp;
But here&rsquo;s where it is, you see: when you&rsquo;ve been
knocking about on blue water for a matter of two-and-forty year,
shipwrecked here, and blown up there, and everywhere out of luck,
and given over for dead by all your messmates and relations, why,
what it amounts to is this: nobody knows you, and you hardly know
yourself, and there you are; and I&rsquo;ll trouble you for
another noggin of rum.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>.&nbsp; I think
you&rsquo;ve had enough.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t; so bear a
hand.&nbsp; (<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>;

so genteel and amicable-like, what about my old commander?&nbsp;
Is he, in a manner of speaking, on half pay? or is he living on
his fortune, like a gentleman slaver ought?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>.&nbsp; Well, sailor,
people talk, you know.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; I know, ma&rsquo;am;
I&rsquo;d have been rolling in my coach, if they&rsquo;d have
held their tongues.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>.&nbsp; And they do say
that Captain Gaunt, for so pious a man, is little better than a
miser.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t say it,
ma&rsquo;am; not to old Pew.&nbsp; Ah, how often have I up and
strove with him!&nbsp; &lsquo;Cap&rsquo;n, live it down,&rsquo;
says I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, Pew,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re
a better man than I am,&rsquo; he says; &lsquo;but dammne,&rsquo;
he says, &lsquo;money,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;is like rum to
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; (<i>Insinuating</i>.)&nbsp; And what about a old
sea-chest, hey? a old sea-chest, strapped with brass bands?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>.&nbsp; Why,
that&rsquo;ll be the chest in his parlour, where he has it bolted
to the wall, as I&rsquo;ve seen with my own eyes; and so might
you, if you had eyes to see with.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; No, ma&rsquo;am, that
ain&rsquo;t good enough; you don&rsquo;t bam old Pew.&nbsp; You
never was in that parlour in your life.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>.&nbsp; I never
was?&nbsp; Well, I declare!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Well then, if you was,
where&rsquo;s the chest?&nbsp; Beside the chimbley, hey?&nbsp;
(<i>Winking</i>.)&nbsp; Beside the table with the &rsquo;oly
Bible?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>.&nbsp; No, sailor, you
don&rsquo;t get any information out of me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; What, ma&rsquo;am?&nbsp;
Not to old Pew?&nbsp; Why, my god-child showed it me herself, and
I told her where she&rsquo;d find my name&mdash;P, E, W,
Pew&mdash;cut out on the starn of it; and sure enough she
did.&nbsp; Why, ma&rsquo;am, it was his old money-box when he was
in the Guinea trade; and they do say he keeps the rhino in it
still.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>.&nbsp; No, sailor,
nothing out of me!&nbsp; And if you want to know, you can ask the
Admiral himself!&nbsp; (<i>She crosses</i>, <i>L.</i>)</p>

you?&nbsp; Come and welcome the prodigal!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span> (<i>coming forward to
meet him as he enters</i>; <span class="smcap">Pew</span>
<i>remains concealed by the settle</i>, <i>smoking</i>,
<i>drinking</i>, <i>and listening</i>).&nbsp; Lord bless us and
save us, if it ain&rsquo;t my boy!&nbsp; Give us a kiss.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; That I will, and twenty
if you like, old girl.&nbsp; (<i>Kisses her</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>.&nbsp; O Kit, Kit,
you&rsquo;ve been at those other houses, where the stuff they
give you, my dear, it is poison for a dog.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Round with friends,
mother: only round with friends.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>.&nbsp; Well, anyway,
you&rsquo;ll take a glass just to settle it, from me.&nbsp;
(<i>She brings the bottle</i>, <i>and fills for him</i>.)&nbsp;
There, that&rsquo;s pure; that&rsquo;ll do you no harm.]&nbsp;
But O, Kit, Kit, I thought you were done with all this
Jack-a-shoring.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; What cheer,
mother?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m only a sheet in the wind; and who&rsquo;s
the worse for it but me?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>.&nbsp; Ah, and that dear
young lady; and her waiting and keeping single these two years
for the love of you!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; She, mother? she&rsquo;s
heart of oak, she&rsquo;s true as steel, and good as gold; and
she has my ring on her finger, too.&nbsp; But where&rsquo;s the
use?&nbsp; The Admiral won&rsquo;t look at me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re as good a man as him any day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Am I?&nbsp; He says
I&rsquo;m a devil, and swears that none of his flesh and
blood&mdash;that&rsquo;s what he said, mother!&mdash;should lie
at my mercy.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what cuts me.&nbsp; If it
wasn&rsquo;t for the good stuff I&rsquo;ve been taking aboard,
and the jolly companions I&rsquo;ve been seeing it out with,
I&rsquo;d just go and make a hole in the water, and be done with
it, I would, by George!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s like
you men.&nbsp; Ah, we know you, we that keeps a
public-house&mdash;we know you, good and bad: you go off on a
frolic and forget; and you never think of the women that sit
crying at home.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Crying?&nbsp; Arethusa
cry?&nbsp; Why, dame, she&rsquo;s the bravest-hearted girl in all
broad England!&nbsp; Here, fill the glass!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll win
her yet.&nbsp; I drink to her; here&rsquo;s to her bright eyes,
and here&rsquo;s to the blessed feet she walks upon!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span> (<i>looking round the corner of
the settle</i>).&nbsp; Spoke like a gallant seaman, every
inch.&nbsp; Shipmate, I&rsquo;m a man as has suffered, and
I&rsquo;d like to shake your fist, and drink a can of flip with
you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span> (<i>coming down</i>).&nbsp;
Hullo, my hearty! who the devil are you?&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s this,
mother?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>.&nbsp; Nay, I know
nothing about him.&nbsp; (<i>She goes out</i>, <i>R.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Cap&rsquo;n, I&rsquo;m a
brother seaman, and my name is Pew, old David Pew, as you may
have heard of in your time, he having sailed along of &rsquo;Awke
and glorious Benbow, and a right-&rsquo;and man to both.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Benbow?&nbsp; Steady,
mate!&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye mean to say you went to sea before you
were born?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; See now!&nbsp; The sign
of this here inn was running in my &rsquo;ed, I reckon.&nbsp;
Benbow, says you? no, not likely!&nbsp; Anson, I mean; Anson and
Sir Edward &rsquo;Awke: that&rsquo;s the pair: I was their
right-&rsquo;and man.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Well, mate, you may be
all that, and more; but you&rsquo;re a rum un to look at,
anyhow.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Right you are, and so I
am.&nbsp; But what is looks?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the &rsquo;art that
does it: the &rsquo;art is the seaman&rsquo;s star; and
here&rsquo;s old David Pew&rsquo;s, a matter of fifty years at
sea, but tough and sound as the British Constitootion.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re right
there, Pew.&nbsp; Shake hands upon it.&nbsp; And you&rsquo;re a
man they&rsquo;re down upon, just like myself, I see.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;re a pair of plain, good-hearted, jolly tars; and all
these &rsquo;longshore fellows cock a lip at us, by George.&nbsp;
What cheer, mate?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span> (<i>without</i>).&nbsp;
Mrs. Drake!&nbsp; Mrs. Drake!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; What, a female? hey? a
female?&nbsp; Board her board her, mate!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
dark.&nbsp; (<i>He retires again behind</i>, <i>to table</i>,
<i>R.</i>, <i>behind settle</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span> (<i>without</i>).&nbsp;
Mrs. Drake!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span> (<i>re-entering and
running to door</i>).&nbsp; Here I am, my dear; come in.</p>
<h4>SCENE III</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>To these</i>, <span
class="smcap">Arethusa</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Ah, Kit, I&rsquo;ve
found you.&nbsp; I thought you would lodge with Mrs. Drake.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; What? are you looking
for your consort?&nbsp; Whistle, I&rsquo;m your dog; I&rsquo;ll
come to you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been toasting you fathom deep, my
beauty; and with every glass I love you dearer.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Now Kit, if you
want to please my father, this is not the way.&nbsp; Perhaps he
thinks too much of the guineas: well, gather them&mdash;if you
think me worth the price.&nbsp; Go you to your sloop, clinker
built, eighty tons burthen&mdash;you see I remember, Skipper
Kit!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t deny I like a man of spirit; but if you
care to please Captain Gaunt, keep out of taverns; and if you
could carry yourself a bit more&mdash;more elderly!</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Can I?&nbsp; Would
I?&nbsp; Ah, just couldn&rsquo;t and just won&rsquo;t I,
then!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>.&nbsp; I hope, madam,
you don&rsquo;t refer to my house; a publican I may be, but
tavern is a word that I don&rsquo;t hold with; and here
there&rsquo;s no bad drink, and no loose company; and as for my
blessedest Kit, I declare I love him like my own.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Why, who could help
it, Mrs. Drake?]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Arethusa, you&rsquo;re
an angel.&nbsp; Do I want to please Captain Gaunt?&nbsp; Why,
that&rsquo;s as much as ask whether I love you.&nbsp; [I
don&rsquo;t deny that his words cut me; for they did.&nbsp; But
as for wanting to please him, if he was deep as the blue
Atlantic, I would beat it out.&nbsp; And elderly, too?&nbsp; Aha,
you witch, you&rsquo;re wise!&nbsp; Elderly?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve
set the course; you leave me alone to steer it.&nbsp;
Matrimony&rsquo;s my port, and love is my cargo.]&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s a likely question, ain&rsquo;t it, Mrs. Drake?&nbsp;
Do I want to please him!&nbsp; Elderly, says you?&nbsp; Why, see
here: Fill up my glass, and I&rsquo;ll drink to Arethusa on my
knees.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Why, you stupid
boy, do you think that would please him?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; On my knees I&rsquo;ll
drink it!&nbsp; (<i>As he kneels and drains the glass</i>, <span
class="smcap">Gaunt</span> <i>enters</i>, <i>and he scrambles to
his feet</i>.)</p>
<h4>SCENE IV</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>To these</i>, <span
class="smcap">Gaunt</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; Arethusa, this is no
place for you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; No, father.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; I wish you had been
spared this sight; but look at him, child, since you are here;
look at God&rsquo;s image, so debased.&nbsp; And you, young man
(<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Kit</span>), you have proved that
I was right.&nbsp; Are you the husband for this innocent
maid?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Captain Gaunt, I have a
word to say to you.&nbsp; Terror is your last word; you&rsquo;re
bitter hard upon poor sinners, bitter hard and black&mdash;you
that were a sinner yourself.&nbsp; These are not the true
colours: don&rsquo;t deceive yourself; you&rsquo;re out of your
course.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; Heaven forbid that I
should be hard, Christopher.&nbsp; It is not I; it&rsquo;s
God&rsquo;s law that is of iron.&nbsp; Think! if the blow were to
fall now, some cord to snap within you, some enemy to plunge a
knife into your heart; this room, with its poor taper light, to
vanish; this world to disappear like a drowning man into the
great ocean; and you, your brain still whirling, to be snatched
into the presence of the eternal Judge: Christopher French, what
answer would you make?&nbsp; For these gifts wasted, for this
rich mercy scorned, for these high-handed bravings of your better
angel,&mdash;what have you to say?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Well, sir, I want my
word with you, and by your leave I&rsquo;ll have it out.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Kit, for
pity&rsquo;s sake!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Arethusa, I don&rsquo;t
speak to you, my dear: you&rsquo;ve got my ring, and I know what
that means.&nbsp; The man I speak to is Captain Gaunt.&nbsp; I
came to-day as happy a man as ever stepped, and with as fair a
look-out.&nbsp; What did you care? what was your reply?&nbsp;
None of your flesh and blood, you said, should lie at the mercy
of a wretch like me!&nbsp; Am I not flesh and blood that you
should trample on me like that?&nbsp; Is that charity, to stamp
the hope out of a poor soul?]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; You speak wildly; or
the devil of drink that is in you speaks instead.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; You think me drunk?
well, so I am, and whose fault is it but yours?&nbsp; It was I
that drank; but you take your share of it, Captain Gaunt: you it
was that filled the can.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; Christopher French, I
spoke but for your good, your good and hers.&nbsp; &lsquo;Woe
unto him&rsquo;&mdash;these are the dreadful
words&mdash;&lsquo;by whom offences shall come: it were
better&mdash;&rsquo; Christopher, I can but pray for both of
us.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Prayers?&nbsp; Now I
tell you freely, Captain Gaunt, I don&rsquo;t value your
prayers.&nbsp; Deeds are what I ask; kind deeds and
words&mdash;that&rsquo;s the true-blue piety: to hope the best
and do the best, and speak the kindest.&nbsp; As for you, you
insult me to my face; and then you&rsquo;ll pray for me?&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s that?&nbsp; Insult behind my back is what I call
it!&nbsp; No, sir; you&rsquo;re out of the course; you&rsquo;re
no good man to my view, be you who you may.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>.&nbsp; O
Christopher!&nbsp; To Captain Gaunt?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Father, father,
come away!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Ah, you see?&nbsp; She
suffers too; we all suffer.&nbsp; You spoke just now of a devil;
well, I&rsquo;ll tell you the devil you have: the devil of
judging others.&nbsp; And as for me, I&rsquo;ll get as drunk as
Bacchus.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; Come!</p>

<span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>, <span
class="smcap">Kit</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span> (<i>coming out and waving his
pipe</i>).&nbsp; Commander, shake!&nbsp; Hooray for old
England!&nbsp; If there&rsquo;s anything in the world that goes
to old Pew&rsquo;s &rsquo;art, it&rsquo;s argyment.&nbsp;
Commander, you handled him like a babby, kept the weather gauge,
and hulled him every shot.&nbsp; Commander, give it a name, and
let that name be rum!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Ay, rum&rsquo;s the
sailor&rsquo;s fancy.&nbsp; Mrs. Drake, a bottle and clean
glasses.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>.&nbsp; Kit French, I
wouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Think better of it, there&rsquo;s a
dear!&nbsp; And that sweet girl just gone!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;m
not a &rsquo;ard man; I&rsquo;m not the man to up and force a act
of parleyment upon a helpless female.&nbsp; But you see here:
Pew&rsquo;s friends is sacred.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s my friend here,
a perfeck seaman, and a man with a &rsquo;ed upon his shoulders,
and a man that, damme, I admire.&nbsp; He give you a order,
ma&rsquo;am:&mdash;march!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>.&nbsp; Kit, don&rsquo;t
you listen to that blind man; he&rsquo;s the devil wrote upon his
face.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
insinuate against my friend.&nbsp; <i>He</i> ain&rsquo;t a child,
I hope? <i>he</i> knows his business?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you get
trying to go a lowering of my friend in his own esteem.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ll
bring it, Kit; but it&rsquo;s against the grain.&nbsp;
(<i>Exit</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; I say, old boy, come to
think of it, why should we?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been glasses round
with me all day.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got my cargo.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; You? and you just
argy&rsquo;d the &rsquo;ed off of Admiral Guinea?&nbsp; O stash
that!&nbsp; <i>I</i> stand treat, if it comes to that!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; What!&nbsp; Do I meet
with a blind seaman and not stand him?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s not the
man I am!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span> (<i>re-entering with
bottle and glasses</i>).&nbsp; There!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Easy does it,
ma&rsquo;am.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Mrs. Drake, you had
better trot.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>.&nbsp; Yes, I&rsquo;ll
trot; and I trot with a sick heart, Kit French, to leave you
drinking your wits away with that low blind man.&nbsp; For a low
man you are&mdash;a low blind man&mdash;and your clothes they
would disgrace a scarecrow.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go to my bed, Kit;
and O, dear boy, go soon to yours&mdash;the old room, you know;
it&rsquo;s ready for you&mdash;and go soon and sleep it off; for
you know, dear, they, one and all, regret it in the morning;
thirty years I&rsquo;ve kept this house, and one and all they did
regret it, dear.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Come now, you walk!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Drake</span>.&nbsp; O, it&rsquo;s not
for your bidding.&nbsp; You a seaman?&nbsp; The ship for you to
sail in is the hangman&rsquo;s cart.&mdash;Good-night, Kit dear,
and better company!</p>
<h4>SCENE VI</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>, <span

L.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Commander, here&rsquo;s

<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Ay, that&rsquo;s the
line: <i>her</i> health!&nbsp; But that old woman there is a good
old woman, Pew.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; So she is,
Commander.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s no woman understands a seaman;
now you and me, being both bred to it, we splice by
natur&rsquo;.&nbsp; As for A. G., if argyment can win her, why,
she&rsquo;s yours.&nbsp; If I&rsquo;d a-had your &rsquo;ed for
argyment, damme, I&rsquo;d a-been a Admiral, I would!&nbsp; And
if argyment won&rsquo;t win her, well, see here, you put your
trust in David Pew.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; David Pew, I don&rsquo;t
know who you are, David Pew; I never heard of you; I don&rsquo;t
seem able to clearly see you.&nbsp; Mrs. Drake, she&rsquo;s a
smart old woman, Pew, and she says you&rsquo;ve the devil in your
face.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Ah, and why, says
you?&nbsp; Because I up and put her in her place, when she forgot
herself to you, Commander.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Well, Pew, that&rsquo;s
so; you stood by me like a man.&nbsp; Shake hands, Pew; and
we&rsquo;ll make a night of it, or we&rsquo;ll know why, old
boy!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my
way.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s Pew&rsquo;s way, that is.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s Pew&rsquo;s way all over.&nbsp; Commander, excuse
the liberty; but when I was your age, making allowance for a
lowlier station and less &rsquo;ed for argyment, I was as like
you as two peas.&nbsp; I know it by the v&rsquo;ice
(<i>sings</i>)&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;We hadn&rsquo;t been three days at sea
before we saw a sail,<br />
So we clapped on every stitch would stand, although it blew a

And we walked along full fourteen knots, for the barkie she did
know<br />
As well as ever a soul on board, &rsquo;twas time for us to

<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; I say, Pew, how&rsquo;s
this?&nbsp; How do you know about Admiral Guinea?&nbsp; I say,
Pew, I begin to think you know too much.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; I ax your pardon; but as

dog, you&rsquo;re a deep dog, Pew; but you can&rsquo;t get the

I&rsquo;ll tell you.&nbsp; I make it out like this: Your
name&rsquo;s Pew, ain&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; Very well.&nbsp; And you
know Admiral Guinea, and that&rsquo;s his name, eh?&nbsp; Very
well.&nbsp; Then you&rsquo;re Pew; and the Admiral&rsquo;s the
Admiral; and you know the Admiral; and by George, that&rsquo;s
all.&nbsp; Hey?&nbsp; Drink about, boys, drink about!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Lord love you, if
I&rsquo;d a-had a &rsquo;ed like yours!&nbsp; Why the Admiral was
my first cap&rsquo;n.&nbsp; I was that man&rsquo;s bo&rsquo;sun,
I was, aboard the <i>Arethusa</i>; and we was like two
brothers.&nbsp; Did you never hear of Guinea-land and the black
ivory business? (<i>sings</i>)&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;A quick run to the south we had, and when
we made the Bight<br />
We kept the offing all day long and crossed the bar at night.<br

And when we&rsquo;d clapped the hatches on, &rsquo;twas time for
us to go.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; I say, Pew, I like you;
you&rsquo;re a damned ugly dog; but I like you.&nbsp; But look ye
here, Pew: fair does it, you know, or we part company this
minute.&nbsp; If you and the Ad&mdash;the Admirable were like
brothers on the Guinea coast, why aren&rsquo;t you like brothers
here?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Ah, <i>I</i> see you
coming.&nbsp; What a &rsquo;ed! what a &rsquo;ed!&nbsp; Since Pew
is a friend of the family, says you, why didn&rsquo;t he sail in
and bear a hand, says you, when you was knocking the
Admiral&rsquo;s ship about his ears in argyment?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Well, Pew, now you put a
name to it, why not?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Ah, why not?&nbsp; There
I recko&rsquo;nise you.&nbsp; [Well, see here: argyment&rsquo;s
my weakness, in a manner of speaking; I wouldn&rsquo;t a-borne
down and spiled sport, not for gold untold, no, not for rum, I
wouldn&rsquo;t!&nbsp; And besides, Commander, I put it to you, as
between man and man, would it have been seaman-like to let on and
show myself to a old shipmate, when he was yard-arm to yard-arm
with a craft not half his metal, and getting blown out of water
every broadside?&nbsp; Would it have been &rsquo;ansome?&nbsp; I
put it to you, as between man and man.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Pew, I may have gifts;
but I never thought of that.&nbsp; Why, no: not
seaman-like.&nbsp; Pew, you&rsquo;ve a heart; that&rsquo;s what I
like you for.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Ah, that I have:
you&rsquo;ll see.&nbsp; I wanted&mdash;now you follow me&mdash;I
wanted to keep square with Admiral Guinea.]&nbsp; Why? says
you.&nbsp; Well, put it that I know a fine young fellow when I
sees him; and put it that I wish him well; and put it, for the
sake of argyment, that the father of that lovely female&rsquo;s
in my power.&nbsp; Aha?&nbsp; Pew&rsquo;s Power!&nbsp; Why, in my
&rsquo;ands he&rsquo;s like this pocket
&rsquo;andke&rsquo;cher.&nbsp; Now, brave boy, do you see?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; No, Pew, my head&rsquo;s
gone; I don&rsquo;t see.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Why, cheer up,
Commander!&nbsp; You want to marry this lovely female?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Ay, that I do; but
I&rsquo;m not fit for her, Pew; I&rsquo;m a drunken dog, and
I&rsquo;m not fit for her.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Now, Cap&rsquo;n,
you&rsquo;ll allow a old seaman to be judge: one as sailed with
&rsquo;Awke and blessed Benb&mdash; with &rsquo;Awke and noble
Anson.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve been open and above-board with me, and
I&rsquo;ll do the same by you: it being the case that
you&rsquo;re hard hit about a lovely woman, which many a time and
oft it has happened to old Pew; and him with a feeling &rsquo;art
that bleeds for you, Commander; why look here: I&rsquo;m that
girl&rsquo;s godfather; promised and vowed for her, I did; and I
like you; and you&rsquo;re the man for her; and, by the living
Jacob, you shall splice!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; David Pew, do you mean
what you say?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Do I mean what I
say?&nbsp; Does David Pew?&nbsp; Ask Admiral &rsquo;Awke!&nbsp;
Ask old Admiral Byng in his coffin, where I laid him with these
lands!&nbsp; Pew does, is what those naval commanders would
reply.&nbsp; Mean it?&nbsp; I reckon so.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Then, shake hands.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re an honest man, Pew&mdash;old Pew!&mdash;and
I&rsquo;ll make your fortune.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s something
else, if I could keep the run of it.&nbsp; O, ah!&nbsp; But
<i>can</i> you?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the point.&nbsp; Can you;
don&rsquo;t you see?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Can I?&nbsp; You leave
that to me; I&rsquo;ll bring you to your moorings; I&rsquo;m the
man that can, and I&rsquo;m him that will.&nbsp; But only, look
here, let&rsquo;s understand each other.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a
bold blade, ain&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t stick at a
trifle for a lovely female?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll back me up?&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re a man, ain&rsquo;t you? a man, and you&rsquo;ll see
me through and through it, hey?&nbsp; Come; is that so?&nbsp; Are
you fair and square and stick at nothing?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Me, Pew?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll go through fire and water.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll risk
it.&mdash;Well, then, see here, my son: another swallow and we
jog.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; No, not to-night, Pew,
not to-night!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Commander, in a manner
of speaking, wherefore?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Wherefore, Pew?&nbsp;
&rsquo;Cause why, Pew?&nbsp; &rsquo;Cause I&rsquo;m drunk, and be
damned to you!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Commander, I ax your
pardon; but, saving your presence, that&rsquo;s a lie.&nbsp;
What? drunk? a man with a &rsquo;ed for argyment like that? just
you get up, and steady yourself on your two pins, and
you&rsquo;ll be as right as ninepence.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Pew, before we budge,
let me shake your flipper again.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re heart of oak,
Pew, sure enough; and if you can bring the Adam&mdash;Admirable
about, why, damme, I&rsquo;ll make your fortune!&nbsp; How
you&rsquo;re going to do it, I don&rsquo;t know; but I&rsquo;ll
stand by; and I know you&rsquo;ll do it if anybody can.&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;m drunk, Pew; you can&rsquo;t deny that: I&rsquo;m as
drunk as a Plymouth fiddler, Pew; and how you&rsquo;re going to
do it is a mystery to me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Ah, you leave that to
me.&nbsp; All I want is what I&rsquo;ve got: your promise to
stand by and bear a hand (<i>producing a dark
lantern</i>).]&nbsp; Now, here, you see, is my little glim; it
ain&rsquo;t for me, because I&rsquo;m blind, worse luck! and the
day and night is the blessed same to David Pew.&nbsp; But you
watch.&nbsp; You put the candle near me.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s what
there ain&rsquo;t mony blind men could do, take the pick o&rsquo;
them! (<i>lighting a screw of paper</i>, <i>and with that</i>,
<i>the lantern</i>).&nbsp; Hey?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s it.&nbsp;
Hey?&nbsp; Go and pity the poor blind!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span> (<i>while</i> <span
class="smcap">Pew</span> <i>blows out the candles</i>).&nbsp; But
I say, Pew, what do you want with it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; To see by, my son.&nbsp;
(<i>He shuts the lantern and puts it in his pocket</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Stage quite dark</i>.&nbsp; <i>Moonlight at window</i>.)&nbsp;
All ship-shape?&nbsp; No sparks about?&nbsp; No?&nbsp; Come,
then, lean on me and heave ahead for the lovely female.&nbsp;

<h4>SCENE I</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Arethusa</span>, <span
class="smcap">Gaunt</span></p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Gaunt</span> (<i>reading</i>).&nbsp;
&lsquo;And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return
from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and
where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people,
and thy God my God: Where thou diest, will I die, and there will
I be buried: the Lord do so to me, and more also, if aught but
death part thee and me.&rsquo;&nbsp; (<i>He closes the
book</i>.)&nbsp; Amen.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Amen.&nbsp; Father,
there spoke my heart.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; Arethusa, the Lord in
his mercy has seen right to vex us with trials of many
kinds.&nbsp; It is a little matter to endure the pangs of the
flesh: the smart of wounds, the passion of hunger and thirst, the
heaviness of disease; and in this world I have learned to take
thought for nothing save the quiet of your soul.&nbsp; It is
through our affections that we are smitten with the true pain,
even the pain that kills.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; And yet this pain
is our natural lot.&nbsp; Father, I fear to boast, but I know
that I can bear it.&nbsp; Let my life, then, flow like common
lives, each pain rewarded with some pleasure, each pleasure
linked with some pain: nothing pure whether for good or evil: and
my husband, like myself and all the rest of us, only a poor,
kind-hearted sinner, striving for the better part.&nbsp; What
more could any woman ask?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; Child, child, your
words are like a sword.&nbsp; What would she ask?&nbsp; Look upon
me whom, in the earthly sense, you are commanded to
respect.&nbsp; Look upon me: do I bear a mark? is there any
outward sign to bid a woman avoid and flee from me?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; I see nothing but
the face I love.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; There is none: nor yet
on the young man Christopher, whose words still haunt and upbraid
me.&nbsp; Yes, I am hard; I was born hard, born a tyrant, born to
be what I was, a slaver captain.&nbsp; But to-night, and to save
you, I will pluck my heart out of my bosom.&nbsp; You shall know
what makes me what I am; you shall hear, out of my own life, why
I dread and deprecate this marriage.&nbsp; Child, do you remember
your mother?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Remember her?&nbsp;
Ah, if she had been here to-day!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; It is thirteen years
since she departed, and took with her the whole sunshine of my
life.&nbsp; Do you remember the manner of her departure?&nbsp;
You were a child, and cannot; but I can and do.&nbsp; Remember?
shall I ever forget?&nbsp; Here or hereafter, ever forget!&nbsp;
Ten years she was my wife, and ten years she lay a-dying.&nbsp;
Arethusa, she was a saint on earth; and it was I that killed
her.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Killed her? my
mother?&nbsp; You?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; Not with my hand; for
I loved her.&nbsp; I would not have hurt one hair upon her
head.&nbsp; But she got her death by me, as sure as by a
blow.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; I
understand&mdash;I can see: you brood on trifles,
misunderstandings, unkindnesses you think them; though my mother
never knew of them, or never gave them a second thought.&nbsp; It
is natural, when death has come between.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; I married her from
Falmouth.&nbsp; She was comely as the roe; I see her
still&mdash;her dove&rsquo;s eyes and her smile!&nbsp; I was
older than she; and I had a name for hardness, a hard and wicked
man; but she loved me&mdash;my Hester!&mdash;and she took me as I
was.&nbsp; O how I repaid her trust!&nbsp; Well, our child was
born to us; and we named her after the brig I had built and
sailed, the old craft whose likeness&mdash;older than you,
girl&mdash;stands there above our heads.&nbsp; And so far, that
was happiness.&nbsp; But she yearned for my salvation; and it was
there I thwarted her.&nbsp; My sins were a burden upon her
spirit, a shame to her in this world, her terror in the world to
come.&nbsp; She talked much and often of my leaving the
devil&rsquo;s trade I sailed in.&nbsp; She had a tender and a
Christian heart, and she would weep and pray for the poor heathen
creatures that I bought and sold and shipped into misery, till my
conscience grew hot within me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve put on my hat,
and gone out and made oath that my next cargo should be my last;
but it never was, that oath was never kept.&nbsp; So I sailed
again and again for the Guinea coast, until the trip came that
was to be my last indeed.&nbsp; Well, it fell out that we had
good luck trading, and I stowed the brig with these poor heathen
as full as she would hold.&nbsp; We had a fair run westward till
we were past the line; but one night the wind rose and there came
a hurricane, and for seven days we were tossed on the deep seas,
in the hardest straits, and every hand on deck.&nbsp; For several
days they were battened down: all that time we heard their cries
and lamentations, but worst at the beginning; and when at last,
and near dead myself, I crept below&mdash;O! some they were
starved, some smothered, some dead of broken limbs; and the hold
was like a lazar-house in the time of the anger of the Lord!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; O!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; It was two hundred and
five that we threw overboard: two hundred and five lost souls
that I had hurried to their doom.&nbsp; I had many die with me
before; but not like that&mdash;not such a massacre as that; and
I stood dumb before the sight.&nbsp; For I saw I was their
murderer&mdash;body and soul their murderer; and, Arethusa, my
Hester knew it.&nbsp; That was her death-stroke: it felled
her.&nbsp; She had long been dying slowly; but from the hour she
heard that story, the garment of the flesh began to waste and
perish, the fountains of her life dried up; she faded before my
face; and in two months from my landing&mdash;O Hester, Hester,
would God I had died for thee!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Mother!&nbsp; O
poor soul!&nbsp; O poor father!&nbsp; O father, it was hard on
you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; The night she died,
she lay there, in her bed.&nbsp; She took my hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
am going,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;to heaven.&nbsp; For
Christ&rsquo;s sake,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;come after me, and
bring my little maid.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be waiting and wearying
till you come;&rsquo; and she kissed my hand, the hand that
killed her.&nbsp; At that I broke out calling on her to stop, for
it was more than I could bear.&nbsp; But no, she said she must
still tell me of my sins, and how the thought of them had bowed
down her life.&nbsp; &lsquo;And O!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;if I
couldn&rsquo;t prevail on you alive, let my death.&rsquo; . . .
Well, then, she died.&nbsp; What have I done since then?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve laid my course for Hester.&nbsp; Sin, temptation,
pleasure, all this poor shadow of a world, I saw them not: I saw
my Hester waiting, waiting and wearying.&nbsp; I have made my
election sure; my sins I have cast them out.&nbsp; Hester,
Hester, I will come to you, poor waiting one; and I&rsquo;ll
bring your little maid: ay, dearest soul, I&rsquo;ll bring your
little maid safe with me!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; O teach me
how!&nbsp; Show me the way! only show me.&mdash;O mother,
mother!&mdash;If it were paved with fire, show me the way, and I
will walk it bare-foot!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; They call me a
miser.&nbsp; They say that in this sea-chest of mine I hoard my
gold.&nbsp; (<i>He passes R. to chest</i>, <i>takes out key</i>,
<i>and unlocks it</i>.)&nbsp; They think my treasure and my very
soul are locked up here.&nbsp; They speak after the flesh, but
they are right.&nbsp; See!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Her watch? the
wedding ring?&nbsp; O father, forgive me!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; Ay, her watch that
counted the hours when I was away; they were few and sorrowful,
my Hester&rsquo;s hours; and this poor contrivance numbered
them.&nbsp; The ring&mdash;with that I married her.&nbsp; This
chain, it&rsquo;s of Guinea gold; I brought it home for her, the
year before we married, and she wore it to her wedding.&nbsp; It
was a vanity: they are all vanities; but they are the treasure of
my soul.&nbsp; Below here, see, her wedding dress.&nbsp; Ay, the
watch has stopped: dead, dead.&nbsp; And I know that my Hester
died of me; and day and night, asleep and awake, my soul abides
in her remembrance.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; And you come in
your sleep to look at them.&nbsp; O poor father!&nbsp; I
understand&mdash;I understand you now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; In my sleep?&nbsp; Ay?
do I so?&nbsp; My Hester!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; And why, why did
you not tell me?&nbsp; I thought&mdash;I was like the
rest!&mdash;I feared you were a miser.&nbsp; O, you should have
told me; I should have been so proud&mdash;so proud and
happy.&nbsp; I knew you loved her; but not this, not this.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; Why should I have
spoken?&nbsp; It was all between my Hester and me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Father, may I
speak?&nbsp; May I tell you what my heart tells me?&nbsp; You do
not understand about my mother.&nbsp; You loved her&mdash;O, as
few men can love.&nbsp; And she loved you: think how she loved
you!&nbsp; In this world, you know&mdash;you have told
me&mdash;there is nothing perfect.&nbsp; All we men and women
have our sins; and they are a pain to those that love us, and the
deeper the love, the crueller the pain.&nbsp; That is life; and
it is life we ask, not heaven; and what matter for the pain, if
only the love holds on?&nbsp; Her love held: then she was
happy!&nbsp; Her love was immortal; and when she died, her one
grief was to be parted from you, her one hope to welcome you
again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; And you, Arethusa: I
was to bring her little maid.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; God bless her, yes,
and me!&nbsp; But, father, can you not see that she was blessed
among women?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; Child, child, you
speak in ignorance; you touch upon griefs you cannot fathom.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; No, dearest,
no.&nbsp; She loved you, loved you and died of it.&nbsp; Why else
do women live?&nbsp; What would I ask but just to love my Kit and
die for him, and look down from heaven, and see him keep my
memory holy and live the nobler for my sake?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; Ay, do you so love
him?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Even as my mother
loved my father.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; Ay?&nbsp; Then we will
see.&nbsp; What right have I&mdash;You are your mother&rsquo;s
child: better, tenderer, wiser than I.&nbsp; Let us seek guidance
in prayer.&nbsp; Good-night, my little maid.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; O father, I know
you at last.</p>

Can&rsquo;t you foot it soft, you that has daylights and a
glim?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; All right, old
boy.&nbsp; How the devil did we get through the door?&nbsp; Shall
I knock him up?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Stow your gab
(<i>seizing his wrist</i>).&nbsp; Under your breath!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Avast that!&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re a savage dog, aren&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Turn on that glim.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s as right as a
trivet, Pew.&nbsp; What next?&nbsp; By George, Pew, I&rsquo;ll
make your fortune.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Here, now, look round
this room, and sharp.&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye see a old sea-chest?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; See it, Pew? why,
d&rsquo;ye think I&rsquo;m blind?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Take me across, and let
me feel of her.&nbsp; Mum; catch my hand.&nbsp; Ah, that&rsquo;s
her (<i>feeling the chest</i>), that&rsquo;s the Golden
Mary.&nbsp; Now, see here, my bo, if you&rsquo;ve the pluck of a
weevil in a biscuit, this girl is yours; if you hain&rsquo;t, and
think to sheer off, I&rsquo;m blind, but I&rsquo;m deadly.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll keep a
civil tongue in your head all the same.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take
threats from nobody, blind or not.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s knock up the
Admiral and be done with it.&nbsp; What I want is to get rid of
this dark lantern.&nbsp; It makes me feel like a housebreaker, by
George.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span> (<i>seated on chest</i>).&nbsp;
You follow this.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sick of drinking bilge, when I
might be rolling in my coach, and I&rsquo;m dog-sick of Jack
Gaunt.&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s he to be wallowing in gold, when a
better man is groping crusts in the gutter and spunging for
rum?&nbsp; Now, here in this blasted chest is the gold to make
men of us for life: gold, ay, gobs of it; and writin&rsquo;s
too&mdash;things that if I had the proof of &rsquo;em I&rsquo;d
hold Jack Gaunt to the grindstone till his face was flat.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d have done it single-handed; but I&rsquo;m blind, worse
luck: I&rsquo;m all in the damned dark here, poking with a
stick&mdash;Lord, burn up with lime the eyes that saw it!&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s why I raked up you.&nbsp; Come, out with your iron,
and prise the lid off.&nbsp; You shall touch your snack, and have
the wench for nothing; ay, and fling her in the street, when
done.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; So you brought me here
to steal did you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Ay did I; and you
shall.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a biter: I bring blood.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Now, Pew, you came here
on my promise, or I&rsquo;d kill you like a rat.&nbsp; As it is,
out of that door!&nbsp; One, two, three (<i>drawing his
cutlass</i>), and off!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span> (<i>leaping at his throat</i>,
<i>and with a great voice</i>).&nbsp; Help! murder! thieves!</p>
<h4>SCENE III</h4>
<p><i>To these</i>, <span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>, <span
class="smcap">Gaunt</span>, <i>with lights</i>.&nbsp; <i>Stage
light</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Pew</span> <i>has</i> <span
class="smcap">Kit</span> <i>down</i>, <i>and is throttling
him</i></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got him,
Cap&rsquo;n.&nbsp; What, kill my old commander, and rob him of
his blessed child?&nbsp; Not with old Pew!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; Get up, David:
can&rsquo;t you see you&rsquo;re killing him?&nbsp; Unhand, I
say.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; In heaven&rsquo;s
name, who is it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a damned
villain, my pretty; and his name, to the best of my belief, is
French.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Kit?&nbsp; Kit
French?&nbsp; Never!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span> (<i>rising</i>).&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s done for me.&nbsp; (<i>Falls on chest</i>.)</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you take on
about him, ducky; he ain&rsquo;t worth it.&nbsp; Cap&rsquo;n
Gaunt, I took him and I give him up.&nbsp; You was &rsquo;ard on
me this morning, Cap&rsquo;n: this is my way&mdash;Pew&rsquo;s
way, this is&mdash;of paying of you out.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Father, this is the
blind man that came while you were abroad.&nbsp; Sure
you&rsquo;ll not listen to <i>him</i>.&nbsp; And you, Kit, you,
what is this?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Captain Gaunt, that
blind devil has half-throttled me.&nbsp; He brought me
here&mdash;I can&rsquo;t speak&mdash;he has almost killed
me&mdash;and I&rsquo;d been drinking too.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; And you, David Pew,
what do you say?]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Cap&rsquo;n, the rights
of it is this.&nbsp; Me and that young man there was partaking in
a friendly drop of rum at the <i>Admiral Benbow</i> inn; and
I&rsquo;d just proposed his blessed Majesty, when the young man
he ups and says to me: &lsquo;Pew,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;I like
you, Pew: you&rsquo;re a true seaman,&rsquo; he says; &lsquo;and
I&rsquo;m one as sticks at nothing; and damme, Pew,&rsquo; he
says, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make your fortune.&rsquo;&nbsp; [Can he
deny as them was his words?&nbsp; Look at him, you as has eyes:
no, he cannot.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come along of me,&rsquo; he says,
&lsquo;and damme, I&rsquo;ll make your fortune.&rsquo;]&nbsp;
Well, Cap&rsquo;n, he lights a dark lantern (which you&rsquo;ll
find it somewhere on the floor, I reckon), and out we goes, me
follerin&rsquo; his lead, as I thought was &rsquo;art-of-oak and
a true-blue mariner; and the next I knows is, here we was in
here, and him a-askin&rsquo; me to &rsquo;old the glim, while he
prised the lid off of your old sea-chest with his cutlass.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; The chest?&nbsp;
(<i>He leaps</i>, <i>R.</i>, <i>and examines chest</i>.)&nbsp;
Ah!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Leastways, I was to
&rsquo;elp him, by his account of it, while he nailed the rhino,
and then took and carried off that lovely maid of yours; for a
lovely maid she is, and one as touched old Pew&rsquo;s &rsquo;art
Cap&rsquo;n, when I &rsquo;eard that, my blood biled.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Young man,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t know
David Pew,&rsquo; I says; and with that I ups and does my dooty
by him, cutlass and all, like a lion-&rsquo;arted seaman, though
blind.&nbsp; [And then in comes you, and I gives him up: as you
know for a fack is true, and I&rsquo;ll subscribe at the
Assizes.&nbsp; And that, if you was to cut me into junks, is the
truth, the &rsquo;ole truth, and nothing but the truth, world
without end, so help me, amen; and if you&rsquo;ll &rsquo;and me
over the &rsquo;oly Bible, me not having such a thing about me at
the moment, why, I&rsquo;ll put a oath upon it like a man.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Father, have you
heard?</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; I know this man,
Arethusa, and the truth is not in him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Well, and why do we
wait?&nbsp; We know Kit, do we not?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Ay, Captain, you know
the pair of us, and you can see his face and mine.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; Christopher, the facts
are all against you.&nbsp; I find you here in my house at
midnight: you who at least had eyes to see, and must have known
whither you were going.&nbsp; It was this man, not you, who
called me up: and when I came in, it was he who was uppermost and
who gave you up to justice.&nbsp; This unsheathed cutlass is
yours; there hangs the scabbard, empty; and as for the dark
lantern, of what use is light to the blind? and who could have
trimmed and lighted it but you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Ah, Cap&rsquo;n, what a
&rsquo;ed for argyment!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; And now, sir, now that
you have spoken, I claim the liberty to speak on my side.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; Not so.&nbsp; I will
first have done with this man.&nbsp; David Pew, it were too
simple to believe your story as you tell it; but I can find no
testimony against you.&nbsp; From whatever reason, assuredly you
have done me service.&nbsp; Here are five guineas to set you on
your way.&nbsp; Begone at once; and while it is yet time, think
upon your repentance.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Cap&rsquo;n,
here&rsquo;s my respecks.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve turned a pious man,
Cap&rsquo;n; it does my &rsquo;art good to &rsquo;ear you.&nbsp;
But you ain&rsquo;t the only one.&nbsp; O no!&nbsp; I came about
and paid off on the other tack before you, I reckon: you ask the
Chaplain of the Fleet else, as called me on the quarter-deck
before old Admiral &rsquo;Awke himself (<i>touching his hat</i>),
my old commander.&nbsp; [&rsquo;David Pew,&rsquo; he says,
&lsquo;five-and-thirty year have I been in this trade, man and
boy,&rsquo; that chaplain says, &lsquo;and damme, Pew,&rsquo;
says he, &lsquo;if ever I seen the seaman that could rattle off
his catechism within fifty mile of you.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s five
guineas out of my own pocket,&rsquo; he says; &lsquo;and
what&rsquo;s more to the pint,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
speak to my reverend brother-in-law, the Bishop of Dover,&rsquo;
he says; &lsquo;and if ever you leave the sea, and wants a place
as beadle, why damme,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;you go to him, for
you&rsquo;re the man for him, and him for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; David Pew, you never
set your foot on a King&rsquo;s ship in all your life.&nbsp;
There lies the road.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pew</span>.&nbsp; Ah, you was always a
&rsquo;ard man, Cap&rsquo;n, and a &rsquo;ard man to believe,
like Didymus the &rsquo;Ebrew prophet.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s time
for me to go, and I&rsquo;ll be going.&nbsp; My service to you,
Cap&rsquo;n: and I kiss my &rsquo;and to that lovely female.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Time
for us to go,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time for us to go,<br />
And when we&rsquo;d clapped the hatches on,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas time for us to
go.&rsquo;</p>

<span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>, <span
class="smcap">Gaunt</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Now, Kit?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Well, sir, and now?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; I find you here in my
house at this untimely and unseemly hour; I find you there in
company with one who, to my assured knowledge, should long since
have swung in the wind at Execution Dock.&nbsp; What brought
you?&nbsp; Why did you open my door while I slept to such a
companion?&nbsp; Christopher French, I have two treasures.&nbsp;
One (<i>laying his hand on</i> <span
class="smcap">Arethusa&rsquo;s</span> <i>shoulder</i>) I know you
covet.&nbsp; Christopher, is this your love?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Sir, I have been fooled
and trapped.&nbsp; That man declared he knew you, declared he
could make you change your mind about our marriage.&nbsp; I was
drunk, sir, and I believed him: heaven knows I am sober now, and
can see my folly; but I believed him then, and followed
him.&nbsp; He brought me here, he told me your chest was full of
gold that would make men of us for life.&nbsp; At that I saw my
fault, sir, and drew my cutlass; and he, in the wink of an eye,
roared out for help, leaped at my throat like a weasel and had me
rolling on the floor.&nbsp; He was quick, and I, as I tell you,
sir, was off my balance.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; Is this man, Pew, your
enemy?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; No sir; I never saw him
till to-night.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; Then, if you must
stand the justice of your country, come to the proof with a
better plea.&nbsp; What? lantern and cutlass yours; you the one
that knew the house; you the one that saw; you the one overtaken
and denounced; and you spin me a galley yarn like that?&nbsp; If
that is all your defence, you&rsquo;ll hang, sir, hang.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Ah! Father, I give
him up: I will never see him, never speak to him, never think of
him again; I take him from my heart; I give myself wholly up to
you and to my mother; I will obey you in every point&mdash;O, not
at a word merely&mdash;at a finger raised!&nbsp; I will do all
this; I will do anything&mdash;anything you bid me; I swear it in
the face of heaven.&nbsp; Only&mdash;Kit!&nbsp; I love him,
father, I love him.&nbsp; Let him go.</p>
<p>[<span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; Go?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; You let the
other.&nbsp; Open the door again&mdash;for my sake,
father&mdash;in my mother&rsquo;s name&mdash;O, open the door and
let him go.]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Let me go?&nbsp; My
girl, if you had cast me out is morning, good and well: I would
have left you, though it broke my heart.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s a
changed story now; now I&rsquo;m down on my luck, and you come
and stab me from behind.&nbsp; I ask no favour, and I&rsquo;ll
take none; I stand here on my innocence, and God helping me
I&rsquo;ll clear my good name, and get your love again, if
it&rsquo;s love worth having.&nbsp; [Now, Captain Gaunt,
I&rsquo;ve said my say, and you may do your pleasure.&nbsp; I am
my father&rsquo;s son, and I never feared to face the truth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; You have spoken like a
man, French, and you may go.&nbsp; I leave you free.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Nay, sir, not so: not
with my will.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m accused and counted guilty; the
proofs are against me; the girl I love has turned upon me.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll accept no mercy at your hands.]&nbsp; Captain Gaunt, I
am your prisoner.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Kit, dear
Kit&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; Silence!&nbsp; Young
man, I have offered you liberty without bond or condition.&nbsp;
You refuse.&nbsp; You shall be judged.&nbsp; Meanwhile
(<i>opening the door</i>, <i>R.</i>), you will go in here.&nbsp;
I keep your cutlass.&nbsp; The night brings counsel: to-morrow
shall decide.&nbsp; (<i>He locks</i> <span

<h4>SCENE I</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Arethusa</span>, <span class="smcap">Kit</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Come, dear Kit,
come!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;m
here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; O Kit, you are not
angry with me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Have I reason to be
pleased?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Kit, I was
wrong.&nbsp; Forgive me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; O yes.&nbsp; I forgive
you.&nbsp; I suppose you meant it kindly; but there are some
kindnesses a man would rather die than take a gift of.&nbsp; When
a man is accused, Arethusa, it is not that he fears the
gallows&mdash;it&rsquo;s the shame that cuts him.&nbsp; At such a
time as that, the way to help was to stand to your belief.&nbsp;
You should have nailed my colours to the mast, not spoke of
striking them.&nbsp; If I were to be hanged to-morrow, and your
love there, and a free pardon and a dukedom on the other
side&mdash;which would I choose?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Kit, you must judge
me fairly.&nbsp; It was not my life that was at stake, it was
yours.&nbsp; Had it been mine&mdash;mine, Kit&mdash;what had you
done, then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; I am a downright fool; I
saw it inside out.&nbsp; Why, give you up, by George!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Ah, you see!&nbsp;
Now you understand.&nbsp; It was all pure love.&nbsp; When he
said that word&mdash;O!&mdash;death and that disgrace!&nbsp; . .
.&nbsp; But I know my father.&nbsp; He fears nothing so much as
the goodness of his heart; and yet it conquers.&nbsp; He would
pray, he said: and to-night, and by the kindness of his voice, I
knew he was convinced already.&nbsp; All that is wanted, is that
you should forgive me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Arethusa, if you looked
at me like that I&rsquo;d forgive you piracy on the high
seas.&nbsp; I was only sulky; I was boxed up there in the black
dark, and couldn&rsquo;t see my hand.&nbsp; It made me pity that
blind man, by George!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; O, that blind
man!&nbsp; The fiend!&nbsp; He came back, Kit: did you hear him?
he thought we had killed you&mdash;you!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Well, well, it serves me
right for keeping company with such a swab.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; One thing puzzles
me: how did you get in?&nbsp; I saw my father lock the door.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Ah, how?&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s just it.&nbsp; I was a sheet in the wind, you
see.&nbsp; How did we?&nbsp; He did it somehow. . . . By George,
he had a key!&nbsp; He can get in again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Again? that
man!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Ay, can he!&nbsp;
Again!&nbsp; When he likes!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Kit, I am
afraid.&nbsp; O Kit, he will kill my father.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Afraid.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
glad of that.&nbsp; Now, you&rsquo;ll see I&rsquo;m worth my salt
at something.&nbsp; Ten to one he&rsquo;s back to Mrs.
Drake&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll after, and lay him aboard.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; O Kit, he is too
strong for you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Arethusa, that&rsquo;s
below the belt!&nbsp; Never you fear; I&rsquo;ll give a good
account of him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span> (<i>taking cutlass from
the wall</i>).&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be none the worse for this,
dear.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s so
(<i>making cuts</i>).&nbsp; All the same, I&rsquo;m half ashamed
to draw on a blind man; it&rsquo;s too much odds.&nbsp; (<i>He
leaps suddenly against the table</i>.)&nbsp; Ah!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Kit!&nbsp; Are you
ill?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; My head&rsquo;s like a
humming top; it serves me right for drinking.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; O, and the blind
man!&nbsp; (<i>She runs</i>, <i>L.</i>, <i>to the corner
cupboard</i>, <i>brings a bottle and glass</i>, <i>and fills and
offers glass</i>.)&nbsp; Here, lad, drink that.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; To you!&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s better.&nbsp; (<i>Bottle and glass remain on
Gaunt&rsquo;s table</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Suppose you miss
him?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Miss him!&nbsp; The road
is straight; and I can hear the tap-tapping of that stick a mile
away.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span> (<i>listening</i>).&nbsp;
St! my father stirring in his room!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; Let me get clear; tell
him why when I&rsquo;m gone.&nbsp; The door&mdash;?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Locked!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kit</span>.&nbsp; The window!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Quick, quick!&nbsp;

I brought it you from Guinea.&nbsp; (<i>Taking out

why not now&mdash;why will you not be happy now? . . . I swear
this is my last voyage; see, I lay my hand upon the Holy Book and
swear it.&nbsp; One more venture&mdash;for the child&rsquo;s
sake, Hester; you don&rsquo;t think upon your little maid.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; Ah, for my sake, it
was for my sake!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; Ten days out from
Lagos.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a strange sunset, Mr. Yeo.&nbsp; All
hands shorten sail!&nbsp; Lay aloft there, look smart!&nbsp; . .

. Mr. Yeo, she can&rsquo;t live long at this; I have a wife and
child in Barnstaple. . . . Christ, what a sea!&nbsp; Hold on, for
God&rsquo;s sake&mdash;hold on fore and aft!&nbsp; Great God!
(<i>as thought the sea were making a breach over the ship at the

below there . . .&nbsp; No water&mdash;no light&mdash;no
air&mdash;seven days battened down, and the seas mountain high,
and the ship labouring hell-deep!&nbsp; Two hundred and five, two
hundred and five, two hundred and five&mdash;all to eternal
torture!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Arethusa</span>.&nbsp; O pity him, pity
him!&nbsp; Let him sleep, let him forget!&nbsp; Let her prayers
avail in heaven, and let him rest!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaunt</span>.&nbsp; Hester, no,
don&rsquo;t smile at me.&nbsp; Rather tears!&nbsp; I have seen
you weep&mdash;often, often; two hundred and five times.&nbsp;
Two hundred and five!&nbsp; (<i>With ring</i>.)&nbsp; Hester,
here is your ring (<i>he tries to put the ring on his
finger</i>).&nbsp; How comes it in my hand?&nbsp; Not fallen off
again?&nbsp; O no, impossible! it was made smaller, dear, it
can&rsquo;t have fallen off!&nbsp; Ah, you waste away.&nbsp; You
must live, you must, for the dear child&rsquo;s sake, for mine,
Hester, for mine!&nbsp; Ah, the child.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Who am I

<h3>ACT I.</h3>
<p><i>The Stage represents the courtyard of the Auberge des
Adrets</i>.&nbsp; <i>It is surrounded by the buildings of the
inn</i>, <i>with a gallery on the first story</i>,
<i>approached</i>, <i>C.</i>, <i>by a straight flight of
stairs</i>.&nbsp; <i>L. C.</i>, <i>the entrance
doorway</i>.&nbsp; <i>A little in front of this</i>, <i>a small
grated office</i>, <i>containing business table</i>,
<i>brass-bound cabinet</i>, <i>and portable cash-box</i>.&nbsp;
<i>In front</i>, <i>R. and L.</i>, <i>tables and benches</i>;
<i>one</i>, <i>L.</i>, <i>partially laid for a considerable
party</i>.</p>
<h4>SCENE I</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Aline</span> and <span
class="smcap">Maids</span>; <i>to whom</i> <span
class="smcap">Fiddlers</span>; <i>afterwards</i> <span
class="smcap">Dumont</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Charles</span>.&nbsp; <i>As the curtain rises</i>,
<i>the sound of the violins is heard approaching</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Aline</span> <i>and the inn servants</i>, <i>who
are discovered laying the table</i>, <i>dance up to door L.
C.</i>, <i>to meet the</i> <span class="smcap">Fiddlers</span>,
<i>who enter likewise dancing to their own music</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Air</i>: &lsquo;<i>Haste to the Wedding</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp;
<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Fiddlers</span> <i>exeunt playing
into house</i>, <i>R. U. E.</i>&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Aline</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Maids</span> <i>dance back to table</i>, <i>which
they proceed to arrange</i></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Aline</span>.&nbsp; Well, give me fiddles:
fiddles and a wedding feast.&nbsp; It tickles your heart till
your heels make a runaway match of it.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mind
extra work, I don&rsquo;t, so long as there&rsquo;s fun about
it.&nbsp; Hand me up that pile of plates.&nbsp; The quinces
there, before the bride.&nbsp; Stick a pink in the Notary&rsquo;s
glass: that&rsquo;s the girl he&rsquo;s courting.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span> (<i>entering</i>;
<i>with</i> <span class="smcap">Charles</span>).&nbsp; Good
girls, good girls!&nbsp; Charles, in ten minutes from now what
happy faces will smile around that board!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charles</span>.&nbsp; Sir, my good fortune
is complete; and most of all in this, that my happiness has made
my father happy.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; Your father?&nbsp;
Ah, well, upon that point we shall have more to say.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charles</span>.&nbsp; What more remains
that has not been said already?&nbsp; For surely, sir, there are
few sons more fortunate in their father: and, since you approve
of this marriage, may I not conceive you to be in that sense
fortunate in your son?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; Dear boy, there is
always a variety of considerations.&nbsp; But the moment is ill
chosen for dispute; to-night, at least, let our felicity be
unalloyed.&nbsp; (<i>Looking off L. C.</i>)&nbsp; Our guests
arrive: here is our good Curate, and here our cheerful
Notary.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charles</span>.&nbsp; His old infirmity, I
fear.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; But
Charles&mdash;dear boy!&mdash;at your wedding feast!&nbsp; I
should have taken it unneighbourly had he come strictly
sober.</p>
<h4>SCENE II</h4>
<p><i>To these</i>, <i>by the door L. C.</i>, <i>the</i> <span
class="smcap">Curate</span> <i>and the</i> <span
class="smcap">Notary</span>, <i>arm in arm</i>; <i>the latter
owl-like and titubant</i></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Curate</span>.&nbsp; Peace be on this
house!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Notary</span> (<i>singing</i>).&nbsp;
&lsquo;Prove an excuse for the glass.&rsquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; Welcome, excellent
neighbours!&nbsp; The Church and the Law.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Curate</span>.&nbsp; And you, Charles, let
me hope your feelings are in solemn congruence with this
momentous step.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Notary</span> (<i>digging</i> <span
class="smcap">Charles</span> <i>in the ribs</i>).&nbsp;
Married?&nbsp; Lovely bride?&nbsp; Prove an excuse!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span> (<i>to</i> <span
class="smcap">Curate</span>).&nbsp; I fear our friend? perhaps?
as usual? eh?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Curate</span>.&nbsp; Possibly: I had not
yet observed it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; Well, well, his heart
is good.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Curate</span>.&nbsp; He doubtless meant it
kindly.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Notary</span>.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s
Aline?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Aline</span>.&nbsp; Coming, sir!&nbsp;
(<span class="smcap">Notary</span> <i>makes for her</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Curate</span> (<i>capturing
him</i>).&nbsp; You will infallibly expose yourself to
misconstruction.&nbsp; (<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Charles</span>.)&nbsp; Where is your commanding
officer?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charles</span>.&nbsp; Why, sir, we have
quite an alert.&nbsp; Information has been received from Lyons
that the notorious malefactor, Robert Macaire, has broken prison,
and the Brigadier is now scouring the country in his
pursuit.&nbsp; I myself am instructed to watch the visitors to
our house.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; That will do,
Charles: you may go.&nbsp; (<i>Exit</i> <span
class="smcap">Charles</span>.)&nbsp; You have considered the case
I laid before you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Notary</span>.&nbsp; Considered a
case?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; Yes, yes.&nbsp;
Charles, you know, Charles.&nbsp; Can he marry? under these
untoward and peculiar circumstances, can he marry?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Notary</span>.&nbsp; Now, lemme tell you:
marriage is a contract to which there are two constracting
parties.&nbsp; That being clear, I am prepared to argue
categorically that your son Charles&mdash;who, it appears, is not
your son Charles&mdash;I am prepared to argue that one party to a
contract being null and void, the other party to a contract
cannot by law oblige or constrain the first party to constract or
bind himself to any contract, except the other party be able to
see his way clearly to constract himself with him.&nbsp; I donno
if I make myself clear?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; No.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Notary</span>.&nbsp; Now, lemme tell you:
by applying justice of peace might possibly afford relief.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; But how?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Notary</span>.&nbsp; Ay, there&rsquo;s the
rub.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; But what am I to
do?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s not my son, I tell you: Charles is not my
son.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Notary</span>.&nbsp; I know.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; Perhaps a glass of
wine would clear him?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Notary</span>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I
want.&nbsp; (<i>They go out</i>, <i>L. U. E.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Aline</span>.&nbsp; And now, if
you&rsquo;ve done deranging my table, to the cellar for the wine,
the whole pack of you.&nbsp; (<i>Manet sola</i>, <i>considering
table</i>.)&nbsp; There: it&rsquo;s like a garden.&nbsp; If I had
as sweet a table for my wedding, I would marry the Notary.</p>
<h4>SCENE III</h4>
<p><i>The Stage remains vacant</i>.&nbsp; <i>Enter</i>, <i>by
door L. C.</i>, <span class="smcap">Macaire</span>, <i>followed
by</i> <span class="smcap">Bertrand</span> <i>with bundle</i>;
<i>in the traditional costume</i></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Good!&nbsp; No
police.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span> (<i>looking off</i>, <i>L.
C.</i>).&nbsp; Sold again!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; This is a favoured
spot, Bertrand: ten minutes from the frontier: ten minutes from
escape.&nbsp; Blessings on that frontier line!&nbsp; The criminal
hops across, and lo! the reputable man.&nbsp;
(<i>Reading</i>)&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Auberge des Adrets</i>, by John
Paul Dumont.&rsquo;&nbsp; A table set for company; this is fate:
Bertrand, are we the first arrivals?&nbsp; An office; a cabinet;
a cash-box&mdash;aha! and a cash-box, golden within.&nbsp; A
money-box is like a Quaker beauty: demure without, but what a
figure of a woman!&nbsp; Outside gallery: an architectural
feature I approve; I count it a convenience both for love and
war: the troubadour&mdash;twang-twang; the
craftsmen&mdash;(<i>makes as if turning key</i>.)&nbsp; The
kitchen window: humming with cookery; truffles, before
Jove!&nbsp; I was born for truffles.&nbsp; Cock your hat: meat,
wine, rest, and occupation; men to gull, women to fool, and still
the door open, the great unbolted door of the frontier!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; Macaire, I&rsquo;m
hungry.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Bertrand, excuse me,
you are a sensualist.&nbsp; I should have left you in the
stone-yard at Lyons, and written no passport but my own.&nbsp;
Your soul is incorporate with your stomach.&nbsp; Am I not
hungry, too?&nbsp; My body, thanks to immortal Jupiter, is but
the boy that holds the kite-string; my aspirations and designs
swim like the kite sky-high, and overlook an empire.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; If I could get a
full meal and a pound in my pocket I would hold my tongue.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Dreams,
dreams!&nbsp; We are what we are; and what are we?&nbsp; Who are
you? who cares?&nbsp; Who am I? myself.&nbsp; What do we come
from? an accident.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s a mother? an old
woman.&nbsp; A father? the gentleman who beats her.&nbsp; What is
crime? discovery.&nbsp; Virtue? opportunity.&nbsp; Politics? a
pretext.&nbsp; Affection? an affectation.&nbsp; Morality? an
affair of latitude.&nbsp; Punishment? this side the
frontier.&nbsp; Reward? the other.&nbsp; Property? plunder.&nbsp;
Business? other people&rsquo;s money&mdash;not mine, by God! and
the end of life to live till we are hanged.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; Macaire, I came
into this place with my tail between my legs already, and hungry
besides; and then you get to flourishing, and it depresses me
worse than the chaplain in the jail.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; What is a
chaplain?&nbsp; A man they pay to say what you don&rsquo;t want
to hear.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; And who are you
after all? and what right have you to talk like that?&nbsp; By
what I can hear, you&rsquo;ve been the best part of your life in
quod; and as for me, since I&rsquo;ve followed you, what sort of
luck have I had?&nbsp; Sold again!&nbsp; A boose, a blue fright,
two years&rsquo; hard, and the police hot-foot after us even
now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; What is life?&nbsp;
A boose and the police.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; Of course, I know
you&rsquo;re clever; I admire you down to the ground, and
I&rsquo;ll starve without you.&nbsp; But I can&rsquo;t stand it,
and I&rsquo;m off.&nbsp; Good-bye: good luck to you, old man! and
if you want the bundle&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; I am a gentleman of
a mild disposition and, I thank my maker, elegant manners; but
rather than be betrayed by such a thing as you are, with the
courage of a hare, and the manners, by the Lord Harry, of a
jumping-Jack&mdash;(<i>He shows his knife</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; Put it up, put it
up: I&rsquo;ll do what you want.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; What is obedience?
fear.&nbsp; So march straight, or look for mischief.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s not <i>bon ton</i>, I know, and far from
friendly.&nbsp; But what is friendship? convenience.&nbsp; But we
lose time in this amiable dalliance.&nbsp; Come, now an effort of
deportment: the head thrown back, a jaunty carriage of the leg;
crook gracefully the elbow.&nbsp; Thus.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
better.&nbsp; (<i>Calling</i>.)&nbsp; House, house here!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; Are you mad?&nbsp;
We haven&rsquo;t a brass farthing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Now!&mdash;But
before we leave!</p>
<h4>SCENE IV</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>To these</i>, <span
class="smcap">Dumont</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; Gentlemen, what can a
plain man do for your service?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; My good man, in a
roadside inn one cannot look for the impossible.&nbsp; Give one
what small wine and what country fare you can produce.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; Gentlemen, you come
here upon a most auspicious day, a red-letter day for me and my
poor house, when all are welcome.&nbsp; Suffer me, with all
delicacy, to inquire if you are not in somewhat narrow
circumstances?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; My good creature,
you are strangely in error; one is rolling in gold.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; And very
hungry.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; Dear me, and on this
happy occasion I had registered a vow that every poor traveller
should have his keep for nothing, and a pound in his pocket to
help him on his journey.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span> (<i>aside</i>).&nbsp; A
pound in his pocket?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span> (<i>aside</i>).&nbsp; Keep
for nothing?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span> (<i>aside</i>).&nbsp;
Bitten!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span> (<i>aside</i>).&nbsp; Sold
again!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; I will send you what
we have: poor fare, perhaps, for gentlemen like you.</p>
<h4>SCENE V</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>, <span
class="smcap">Bertrand</span>; <i>afterwards</i> <span
class="smcap">Charles</span>, <i>who appears on the gallery</i>,
<i>and comes down</i></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; I told you
so.&nbsp; Why will you fly so high?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Bertrand,
don&rsquo;t crush me.&nbsp; A pound: a fortune!&nbsp; With a
pound to start upon&mdash;two pounds, for I&rsquo;d have borrowed
yours&mdash;three months from now I might have been driving in my
barouche, with you behind it, Bertrand, in a tasteful livery.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span> (<i>seeing</i> <span
class="smcap">Charles</span>).&nbsp; Lord, a policeman!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Steady!&nbsp; What
is a policeman?&nbsp; Justice&rsquo;s blind eye.&nbsp; (<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Charles</span>.)&nbsp; I think, sir, you are
in the force?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charles</span>.&nbsp; I am, sir, and it
was in that character&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Ah, sir, a fine
service!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charles</span>.&nbsp; It is, sir, and if
your papers&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; You become your
uniform.&nbsp; Have you a mother?&nbsp; Ah, well, well!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charles</span>.&nbsp; My duty,
sir&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; They tell me one
Macaire&mdash;is not that his name, Bertrand?&mdash;has broken
jail at Lyons?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charles</span>.&nbsp; He has, sir, and it
is precisely for that reason&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Well,
good-bye.&nbsp; (<i>Shaking</i> <span
class="smcap">Charles</span> <i>by the hand and leading him
towards the door</i>, <i>L. U. E.</i>)&nbsp; Sweet spot, sweet
spot.&nbsp; The scenery is . . . (<i>kisses his
finger-tips</i>.&nbsp; <i>Exit</i> <span
class="smcap">Charles</span>).&nbsp; And now, what is a
policeman?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; A bobby.</p>
<h4>SCENE VI</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>, <span
class="smcap">Bertrand</span>; <i>to whom</i> <span
class="smcap">Aline</span> <i>with tray</i>; <i>and
afterwards</i> <span class="smcap">Maids</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Aline</span> (<i>entering with tray</i>,
<i>and proceeding to lay table</i>, <i>L.</i>)&nbsp; My men, you
are in better luck than usual.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t every day you
go shares in a wedding feast.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; A wedding?&nbsp; Ah,
and you&rsquo;re the bride.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Aline</span>.&nbsp; What makes you fancy
that?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Heavens, am I
blind?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Aline</span>.&nbsp; Well, then, I wish I
was.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; I take you at the
word: have me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Aline</span>.&nbsp; You will never be
hanged for modesty.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Modesty is for the
poor: when one is rich and nobly born, &rsquo;tis but a
clog.&nbsp; I love you.&nbsp; What is your name?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Aline</span>.&nbsp; Guess again, and
you&rsquo;ll guess wrong.&nbsp; (<i>Enter the other servants with
wine baskets</i>.)&nbsp; Here, set the wine down.&nbsp; No, that
is the old Burgundy for the wedding party.&nbsp; These gentlemen
must put up with a different bin.&nbsp; (<i>Setting wine
before</i> <span class="smcap">Macaire</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Bertrand</span>, <i>who are at table</i>,
<i>L.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span> (<i>drinking</i>).&nbsp;
Vinegar, by the supreme Jove!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; Sold again!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Now, Bertrand, mark
me.&nbsp; (<i>Before the servants he exchanges the bottle for the
one in front of</i> <span class="smcap">Dumont&rsquo;s</span>
<i>place at the head of the other table</i>.)&nbsp; Was it well
done?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; Immense.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span> (<i>emptying his glass
into</i> <span class="smcap">Bertrand&rsquo;s</span>).&nbsp;
There, Bertrand, you may finish that.&nbsp; Ha! music?</p>

soup</i>.&nbsp; <i>Then</i>, <i>dropping ladle</i>.)&nbsp; One
word: a matter of detail: Charles is not my son.&nbsp; (<i>All
exclaim</i>.)&nbsp; O no, he is not my son.&nbsp; Perhaps I
should have mentioned it before.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charles</span>.&nbsp; I am not your son,
sir?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; O no, far from
it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Goriot</span>.&nbsp; Then who the
devil&rsquo;s son be he?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; O, I don&rsquo;t
know.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an odd tale, a romantic tale: it may amuse
you.&nbsp; It was twenty years ago, when I kept the <i>Golden
Head</i> at Lyons: Charles was left upon my doorstep in a covered
basket, with sufficient money to support the child till he should
come of age.&nbsp; There was no mark upon the linen, nor any clue
but one: an unsigned letter from the father of the child, which
he strictly charged me to preserve.&nbsp; It was to prove his
identity: he, of course, would know the contents, and he only; so
I keep it safe in the third compartment of my cash-box, with the
ten thousand francs I&rsquo;ve saved for his dowry.&nbsp; Here is
the key; it&rsquo;s a patent key.&nbsp; To-day the poor boy is
twenty-one, to-morrow to be married.&nbsp; I did perhaps hope the
father would appear: there was a Marquis coming; he wrote me for
a room; I gave him the best, Number Thirteen, which you have all
heard of: I did hope it might be he, for a Marquis, you know, is
always genteel.&nbsp; But no, you see.&nbsp; As for me, I take
you all to witness I&rsquo;m as innocent of him as the babe
unborn.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Ahem!&nbsp; I think
you said the linen bore an M?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; Pardon me: the
markings were cut off.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; True.&nbsp; The
basket white, I think?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; Brown, brown.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Ah! brown&mdash;a
whitey-brown.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Goriot</span>.&nbsp; I tell &rsquo;ee
what, Dumont, this is all very well; but in that case, I&rsquo;ll
be danged if he gets my daater.&nbsp; (<i>General
consternation</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; O Goriot, let&rsquo;s
have happy faces!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Goriot</span>.&nbsp; Happy faces be
danged!&nbsp; I want to marry my daater; I want your son.&nbsp;
But who be this?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know, and you don&rsquo;t
know, and he don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; He may be anybody; by Jarge,
he may be nobody!&nbsp; (<i>Exclamations</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Curate</span>.&nbsp; The situation is
crepuscular.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ernestine</span>.&nbsp; Father, and Mr.
Dumont (and you too, Charles), I wish to say one word.&nbsp; You
gave us leave to fall in love; we fell in love; and as for me, my
father, I will either marry Charles, or die a maid.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charles</span>.&nbsp; And you, sir, would
you rob me in one day of both a father and a wife?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span> (<i>weeping</i>).&nbsp;
Happy faces, happy faces!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Goriot</span>.&nbsp; I know nothing about
robbery; but she cannot marry without my consent, and that she
cannot get.</p>

will you permit a gentleman and a traveller to interject one

pleasing qualities; here the young maiden, by her own confession
bashfully consenting to the match; there sits that dear old
gentleman, a lover of bright faces like myself, his own now
dimmed with sorrow; and here&mdash;(may I be allowed to
add?)&mdash;here sits this noble Roman, a father like myself, and
like myself the slave of duty.&nbsp; Last you have me&mdash;Baron

marriage and an obstacle.&nbsp; Now, what is marriage?&nbsp; The
union of two souls, and, what is possibly more romantic, the
fusion of two dowries.&nbsp; What is an obstacle? the
devil.&nbsp; And this obstacle? to me, as a man of family, the
obstacle seems grave; but to me, as a man and a brother, what is
it but a word?&nbsp; O my friend (<i>to</i> <span

of the same noble failings with myself&mdash;of pride of birth,

<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>,
<span class="smcap">Bertrand</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Bertrand, I am
content: a child might play with me.&nbsp; Does your pipe draw
well?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; Like a factory
chimney.&nbsp; This is my notion of life: liquor, a chair, a
table to put my feet on, a fine clean pipe, and no police.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Bertrand, do you see
these changing exhalations? do you see these blue rings and
spirals, weaving their dance, like a round of fairies, on the
footless air?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; I see &rsquo;em
right enough.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Man of little
vision, expound me these meteors! what do they signify, O
wooden-head?&nbsp; Clod, of what do they consist?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; Damned bad
tobacco.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; I will give you a
little course of science.&nbsp; Everything, Bertrand (much as it
may surprise you), has three states: a vapour, a liquid, a
solid.&nbsp; These are fortune in the vapour: these are
ideas.&nbsp; What are ideas? the protoplasm of wealth.&nbsp; To
your head&mdash;which, by the way, is a solid,
Bertrand&mdash;what are they but foul air?&nbsp; To mine, to my
prehensile and constructive intellects, see, as I grasp and work
them, to what lineaments of the future they transform themselves:
a palace, a barouche, a pair of luminous footmen, plate, wine,
respect, and to be honest!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; But what&rsquo;s
the sense in honesty?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; The sense?&nbsp; You
see me: Macaire: elegant, immoral, invincible in cunning; well,
Bertrand, much as it may surprise you, I am simply damned by my
dishonesty.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; No!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; The honest man,
Bertrand, that God&rsquo;s noblest work.&nbsp; He carries the
bag, my boy.&nbsp; Would you have me define honesty? the
strategic point for theft.&nbsp; Bertrand, if I&rsquo;d three
hundred a year, I&rsquo;d be honest to-morrow.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; Ah!&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you wish you may get it!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Bertrand, I will bet
you my head against your own&mdash;the longest odds I can
imagine&mdash;that with honesty for my spring-board, I leap
through history like a paper hoop, and come out among posterity
heroic and immortal.</p>

But I confess that I have so long regarded Mr. Dumont&mdash;</p>

your heart, nor much, comparatively, on your pocket.&nbsp; A

Bertrand.&nbsp; (<i>A dead pause</i>.)&nbsp; Ah, well, this is a
different home-coming from that I fancied when I left the letter:
I dreamed to grow rich.&nbsp; Charles, you remind me of your

<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; How strange is the

peculiarities of both: a patriotic enterprise in which I
fell.&nbsp; This humble fellow . . . have I introduced him?&nbsp;

democracy.&nbsp; Bertrand, shake hands with my family.&nbsp;
(<span class="smcap">Bertrand</span> <i>is rebuffed by one and

<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; Sold again!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Charles, to my
arms!&nbsp; (<i>Business</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ernestine</span>.&nbsp; Well, but now that
he has a father of some kind, cannot the marriage go on?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Angel, this very
night: I burn to take my grandchild on my knees.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Goriot</span>.&nbsp; Be you that young
man&rsquo;s veyther?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Ay, and what a
father!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Goriot</span>.&nbsp; Then all I&rsquo;ve
got to say is, I shan&rsquo;t and I wun&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Ah, friends,
friends, what a satisfaction it is, what a sight is virtue!&nbsp;
I came among you in this poor attire to test you; how nobly have
you borne the test!&nbsp; But my disguise begins to irk me: who
will lend me a good suit?&nbsp; (<i>Business</i>.)</p>
<h4>SCENE III</h4>
<p><i>To these</i>, <i>the</i> <span
class="smcap">Marquis</span>, <i>L. C.</i></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marquis</span>.&nbsp; Is this the house of
John Paul Dumont, once of Lyons?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; It is, sir, and I am
he, at your disposal.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marquis</span>.&nbsp; I am the Marquis
Villers-Cotter&ecirc;ts de la Chert&eacute; de
M&eacute;doc.&nbsp; (<i>Sensation</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Marquis, delighted,
I am sure.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marquis</span> (<i>to</i> <span
class="smcap">Dumont</span>).&nbsp; I come, as you perceive,
unfollowed; my errand, therefore, is discreet.&nbsp; I come
(<i>producing notes from breast-pocket</i>) equipped with thirty
thousand francs; my errand, therefore, must be generous.&nbsp;
Can you not guess?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; Not I, my lord.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marquis</span> (<i>repeating</i>).&nbsp;
&lsquo;Preserve this letter,&rsquo; etc.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Bitten.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; Sold again
(<i>aside</i>).&nbsp; (<i>A pause</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Aline</span>.&nbsp; Well, I never did!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; Two fathers!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marquis</span>.&nbsp; Two?&nbsp;
Impossible.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; Not at all.&nbsp;
This is the other.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marquis</span>.&nbsp; This man?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; This is the man, my
lord; here stands the father; Charles, to my arms!&nbsp; (<span
class="smcap">Charles</span> <i>backs</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; He knew the
letter.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marquis</span>.&nbsp; Well, but so did
I.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Curate</span>.&nbsp; The judgment of
Solomon.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Goriot</span>.&nbsp; What did I tell
&rsquo;ee? he can&rsquo;t marry.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ernestine</span>.&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t
they both consent?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marquis</span>.&nbsp; But he&rsquo;s my
living image.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Mine, Marquis,
mine.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marquis</span>.&nbsp; My figure, I
think?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Ah, Charles,
Charles!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Curate</span>.&nbsp; We used to think his
physiognomy resembled Dumont&rsquo;s.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; Come to look at him,
he&rsquo;s really like Goriot.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ernestine</span>.&nbsp; O papa, I hope
he&rsquo;s not my brother.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Goriot</span>.&nbsp; What be talking
of?&nbsp; I tell &rsquo;ee, he&rsquo;s like our Curate.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charles</span>.&nbsp; Gentlemen, my head
aches.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marquis</span>.&nbsp; I have it: the
involuntary voice of nature.&nbsp; Look at me, my son.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Nay, Charles, but
look at me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Charles</span>.&nbsp; Gentlemen, I am
unconscious of the smallest natural inclination for either.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marquis</span>.&nbsp; Another thought:
what was his mother&rsquo;s name?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; What was the name of
his mother by you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marquis</span>.&nbsp; Sir, you are
silenced.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Silenced by
honour.&nbsp; I had rather lose my boy than compromise his
sainted mother.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marquis</span>.&nbsp; A thought: twins
might explain it: had you not two foundlings?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; Nay, sir, one only;
and judging by the miseries of this evening, I should say, thank
God!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; My friends, leave me
alone with the Marquis.&nbsp; It is only a father that can
understand a father&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; Bertrand, follow the
members of my family.&nbsp; (<i>They troop out</i>, <i>L. U. E.
and R. U. E.</i>, <i>the fiddlers playing</i>.&nbsp; <i>Air</i>:

<h4>SCENE IV</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>,
<span class="smcap">Marquis</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marquis</span>.&nbsp; Well, sir?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; My lord, I feel for
you.&nbsp; (<i>Business</i>.&nbsp; <i>They sit</i>,
<i>R.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marquis</span>.&nbsp; And now, sir?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; The bond that joins
us is remarkable and touching.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marquis</span>.&nbsp; Well, sir?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span> (<i>touching him on the
breast</i>).&nbsp; You have there thirty thousand francs.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marquis</span>.&nbsp; Well, sir?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; I was but thinking
of the inequalities of life, my lord: that I who, for all you
know, may be the father of your son, should have nothing; and
that you who, for all I know, may be the father of mine, should
be literally bulging with bank notes.&nbsp; . . .&nbsp; Where do
you keep them at night?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marquis</span>.&nbsp; Under my
pillow.&nbsp; I think it rather ingenious.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Admirably so!&nbsp;
I applaud the device.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marquis</span>.&nbsp; Well, sir?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Do you snuff, my
lord?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marquis</span>.&nbsp; No, sir, I do
not.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; My lord, I am a poor
man.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marquis</span>.&nbsp; Well, sir? and what
of that?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; The affections, my
lord, are priceless.&nbsp; Money will not buy them; or, at least,
it takes a great deal.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marquis</span>.&nbsp; Sir, your sentiments
do you honour.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; My lord, you are
rich.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marquis</span>.&nbsp; Well, sir?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Now follow me, I
beseech you.&nbsp; Here am I, my lord; and there, if I may so
express myself, are you.&nbsp; Each has the father&rsquo;s heart,
and there we are equal; each claims yon interesting lad, and
there again we are on a par.&nbsp; But, my lord&mdash;and here we
come to the inequality, and what I consider the unfairness of the
thing&mdash;you have thirty thousand francs, and I, my lord, have
not a rap.&nbsp; You mark me? not a rap, my lord!&nbsp; My lord,
put yourself in my position: consider what must be my feelings,
my desires; and&mdash;hey?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marquis</span>.&nbsp; I fail to grasp . .
.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span> (<i>with
irritation</i>).&nbsp; My dear man, there is the door of the
house; here am I; there (<i>touching</i>, <span
class="smcap">Marquis</span> <i>on the breast</i>) are thirty
thousand francs.&nbsp; Well, now?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marquis</span>.&nbsp; I give you my word
of honour, sir, I gather nothing; my mind is quite unused to such
prolonged exertion.&nbsp; If the boy be yours, he is not mine; if
he be mine, he is not yours; and if he is neither of ours, or
both of ours . . . in short, my mind . . .</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; My lord, will you
lay those thirty thousand francs upon the table?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marquis</span>.&nbsp; I fail to grasp . .
. but if it will in any way oblige you . . . (<i>Does
so</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Now, my lord, follow
me: I take them up; you see?&nbsp; I put them in my pocket; you
follow me?&nbsp; This is my hat; here is my stick; and here is
my&mdash;my friend&rsquo;s bundle.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marquis</span>.&nbsp; But that is my
cloak.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Precisely.&nbsp;
Now, my lord, one more effort of your lordship&rsquo;s
mind.&nbsp; If I were to go out of that door, with the full
intention&mdash;follow me close&mdash;the full intention of never
being heard of more, what would you do?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marquis</span>.&nbsp; I!&mdash;send for
the police.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Take your
money!&nbsp; (<i>Dashing down the notes</i>.)&nbsp; Man, if I met
you in a lane!&nbsp; (<i>He drops his head upon the
table</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marquis</span>.&nbsp; The poor soul is
insane.&nbsp; The other man, whom I suppose to be his keeper, is
very much to blame.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span> (<i>raising his
head</i>).&nbsp; I have a light!&nbsp; (<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Marquis</span>.)&nbsp; With invincible oafishness,
my lord, I cannot struggle.&nbsp; I pass you by; I leave you
gaping by the wayside; I blush to have a share in the progeny of
such an owl.&nbsp; Off, off, and send the tapster!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marquis</span>.&nbsp; Poor fellow!</p>
<h4>SCENE V</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>, <i>to whom</i> <span
class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; <i>Afterwards</i> <span
class="smcap">Dumont</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; Well?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Bitten.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; Sold again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Had he the wit of a
lucifer match!&nbsp; But what can gods or men against
stupidity?&nbsp; Still, I have a trick.&nbsp; Where is that
damned old man?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span> (<i>entering</i>).&nbsp; I
hear you want me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Ah, my good old
Dumont, this is very sad.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; Dear me, what is
wrong?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Dumont, you had a
dowry for my son?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; I had; I have: ten
thousand francs.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a poor
thing, but it must do.&nbsp; Dumont, I bury my old hopes, my old
paternal tenderness.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; What? is he not your
son?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Pardon me, my
friend.&nbsp; The Marquis claims my boy.&nbsp; I will not seek to
deny that he attempted to corrupt me, or that I spurned his
gold.&nbsp; It was thirty thousand.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; Noble soul!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; One has a heart . .
. He spoke, Dumont, that proud noble spoke, of the advantages to
our beloved Charles; and in my father&rsquo;s heart a voice
arose, louder than thunder.&nbsp; Dumont, was I unselfish?&nbsp;
The voice said no; the voice, Dumont, up and told me to
begone.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; To begone? to go?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; To begone, Dumont,
and to go.&nbsp; Both, Dumont.&nbsp; To leave my son to marry,
and be rich and happy as the son of another; to creep forth
myself, old, penniless, broken-hearted, exposed to the
inclemencies of heaven and the rebuffs of the police.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; This is what I had
looked for at your hands.&nbsp; Noble, nobleman!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; One has a heart . .
. and yet, Dumont, it can hardly have escaped your penetration
that if I were to shift from this hostelry without a farthing,
and leave my offspring to wallow&mdash;literally&mdash;among
millions, I should play the part of little better than an
ass.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; But I had thought . .
. I had fancied . . .</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; No, Dumont, you had
not; do not seek to impose upon my simplicity.&nbsp; What you did
think was this, Dumont: for the sake of this noble father, for
the sake of this son whom he denies for his own interest&mdash;I
mean, for his interest&mdash;no, I mean, for his own&mdash;well,
anyway, in order to keep up the general atmosphere of sacrifice
and nobility, I must hand over this dowry to the Baron
Henri-Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric de Latour de Main de la Tonnerre de
Brest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; Now Charles is rich

<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; O yes, I
remember.&nbsp; I heard it drop.&nbsp; (<i>Drops key</i>.)&nbsp;
And here it is before my eyes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; That?&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s yours.&nbsp; I saw it drop.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; I give you my word
of honour I heard it fall five minutes back.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; But I saw it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Impossible.&nbsp; It
must be yours.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; It is like mine,
indeed.&nbsp; How came it in your pocket?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Bitten.&nbsp;
(<i>Aside</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; Sold again
(<i>aside</i>) . . . You forget, Baron, it&rsquo;s the key of my
valise; I gave it you to keep in consequence of the hole in my
pocket.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; True, true; and that
explains.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; O, that
explains.&nbsp; Now, all we have to do is to find mine.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a patent key.&nbsp; You heard it drop.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Distinctly.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; So I did:

<h3>ACT III</h3>
<h4>SCENE I</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>,
<span class="smcap">Bertrand</span></p>
<p><i>As the curtain rises</i>, <i>the stage is dark and
empty</i>.&nbsp; <i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Macaire</span>,
<i>L. U. E.</i>, <i>with lantern</i>.&nbsp; <i>He looks
about</i></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span> (<i>calling off</i>).&nbsp;
S&rsquo;st!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span> (<i>entering L. U.
E.</i>).&nbsp; It&rsquo;s creeping dark.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Blinding dark; and a
good job.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; Macaire, I&rsquo;m
cold; my very hair&rsquo;s cold.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Work, work will warm
you: to your keys.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; No, Macaire,
it&rsquo;s a horror.&nbsp; You not kill him; let&rsquo;s have no
bloodshed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; None: it spoils your
clothes.&nbsp; Now, see: you have keys and you have experience;
up that stair, and pick me the lock of that man&rsquo;s
door.&nbsp; Pick me the lock of that man&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; May I take the
light?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; You may not.&nbsp;
Go.&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">Bertrand</span> <i>mounts the
stairs</i>, <i>and is seen picking the lock of Number
Thirteen</i>.)&nbsp; The earth spins eastward, and the day is at
the door.&nbsp; Yet half an hour of covert, and the sun will be
afoot, the discoverer, the great policeman.&nbsp; Yet, half an
hour of night, the good, hiding, practicable night; and lo! at a
touch the gas-jet of the universe turned on; and up with the sun
gets the providence of honest people, puts off his night-cap,
throws up his window, stares out of house&mdash;and the rogue
must skulk again till dusk.&nbsp; Yet half an hour and, Macaire,
you shall be safe and rich.&nbsp; If yon fool&mdash;my
fool&mdash;would but miscarry, if the dolt within would hear and
leap upon him, I could intervene, kill both, by
heaven&mdash;both!&mdash;cry murder with the best, and at one
stroke reap honour and gold.&nbsp; For, Bertrand dead&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span> (<i>from above</i>).&nbsp;
S&rsquo;st, Macaire!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Is it done, dear
boy?&nbsp; Come down.&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>
<i>descends</i>.)&nbsp; Sit down beside this light: this is your
ring of safety, budge not beyond&mdash;the night is crowded with
hobgoblins.&nbsp; See ghosts and tremble like a jelly if you
must; but remember men are my concern; and at the creak of a
man&rsquo;s foot, hist!&nbsp; (<i>Sharpening his knife upon his
sleeve</i>.)&nbsp; What is a knife?&nbsp; A plain man&rsquo;s
sword.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; Not the knife,
Macaire; O, not the knife!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; My name is
Self-Defence.&nbsp; (<i>He goes upstairs and enters Number
Thirteen</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
in.&nbsp; I hear a board creak.&nbsp; What a night, what a
night!&nbsp; Will he hear him?&nbsp; O Lord, my poor
Macaire!&nbsp; I hear nothing, nothing.&nbsp; The night&rsquo;s
as empty as a dream: he must hear him; he cannot help but hear
him; and then&mdash;O Macaire, Macaire, come back to me.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s death, and it&rsquo;s death, and it&rsquo;s
death.&nbsp; Red, red: a corpse.&nbsp; Macaire to kill, Macaire
to die?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d rather starve, I&rsquo;d rather perish,
than either: I&rsquo;m not fit, I&rsquo;m not fit, for
either!&nbsp; Why, how&rsquo;s this?&nbsp; I want to cry.&nbsp;
(<i>A stroke</i>, <i>and groan from above</i>.)&nbsp; God
Almighty, one of them&rsquo;s gone!&nbsp; (<i>He falls with his
head on table</i>, <i>R.</i>&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Macaire</span> <i>appears at the top of the
stairs</i>, <i>descends</i>, <i>comes airily forward and touches
him on the shoulder</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Bertrand</span>, <i>with a cry</i>, <i>turns and
falls upon his neck</i>.)&nbsp; O, O, and I thought I had lost
him.&nbsp; (<i>Day breaking</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; The contrary, dear
boy.&nbsp; (<i>He produces notes</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; What was it
like?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Like?&nbsp;
Nothing.&nbsp; A little blood, a dead man.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; Blood! . . .
Dead!&nbsp; <i>He falls at table sobbing</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Macaire</span> <i>divides the notes into two
parts</i>; <i>on the smaller he wipes the bloody knife</i>,
<i>and folding the stains inward</i>, <i>thrusts the notes
into</i> <span class="smcap">Bertrand&rsquo;s</span>
<i>face</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; What is life without
the pleasures of the table!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span> (<i>taking and pocketing
notes</i>).&nbsp; Macaire, I can&rsquo;t get over it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; My mark is the
frontier, and at top speed.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t hang your jaw at
me.&nbsp; Up, up, at the double; pick me that cash-box; and
let&rsquo;s get the damned house fairly cleared.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Did he bleed much?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Bleed?&nbsp; Must I
bleed you?&nbsp; To work, or I&rsquo;m dangerous.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all
right, Macaire; I&rsquo;m going.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Better so: an old
friend is nearly sacred.&nbsp; (<i>Full daylight: lights
up</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Macaire</span> <i>blows out
lantern</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s the
key?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Key?&nbsp; I tell
you to pick it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span> (<i>with the
box</i>).&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s a patent lock.&nbsp; Where is the
key?&nbsp; You had it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Will you pick that
lock?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t:
it&rsquo;s a patent.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s the key?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; If you will have it,
I put it back in that old ass&rsquo;s pocket.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; Bitten, I
think.&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">Macaire</span> <i>dancing
mad</i>.)</p>
<h4>SCENE II</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>To these</i>, <span

<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; Ah, friends, up so
early?&nbsp; Catching the worm, catching the worm?</p>
<p>(Sitting on the table dissembling box and dissembling box . .
.</p>
<p class="gutindent"><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp;
Good-morning, good-morning!</p>
<p class="gutindent"><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp;
Early birds, early birds.</p>
<p>. . . )</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; By the way, very
remarkable thing: I found the key.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; No!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; O!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; Perhaps a still more
remarkable thing: it was my key that had the twisted handle.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; I told you so.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; Now, what we have to
do is to get the cash-box.&nbsp; Hallo! what&rsquo;s that your
sitting on?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; Nothing.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; The table!&nbsp; I
beg your pardon.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s my
cash-box!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Why, so it is!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very
singular.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Diabolishly
singular.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; Early worms, early
worms!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span> (<i>blowing in
key</i>).&nbsp; Well, I suppose you are still willing to
begone?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; More than willing,
my dear soul: pressed, I may say, for time; for though it had
quite escaped my memory, I have an appointment in Turin with a
lady of title.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span> (<i>at box</i>).&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s very odd.&nbsp; (<i>Blows its key</i>.)&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a singular thing (<i>blowing</i>), key won&rsquo;t
turn.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a patent.&nbsp; Some one must have
tampered with the lock (<i>blowing</i>).&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
strangely singular, it&rsquo;s singularly singular!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve shown this key to commercial gentlemen all the way
from Paris: they never saw a better key! (<i>more
business</i>).&nbsp; Well (<i>giving it up and looking
reproachfully on key</i>), that&rsquo;s pretty singular.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Let me try.&nbsp;
(<i>He tries</i>, <i>and flings down the key with a
curse</i>.)&nbsp; Bitten.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; Sold again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span> (<i>picking up
key</i>).&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a patent key.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span> (<i>to</i> <span
class="smcap">Bertrand</span>).&nbsp; The game&rsquo;s up: we
must save the swag.&nbsp; (<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Dumont</span>.)&nbsp; Sir, since your key, on which
I invoke the blight of Egypt, has once more defaulted, my
feelings are unequal to a repetition of yesterday&rsquo;s
distress, and I shall simply pad the hoof.&nbsp; From Turin you
shall receive the address of my banker, and may prosperity attend
your ventures.&nbsp; (<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.)&nbsp; Now, boy!&nbsp; (<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.)&nbsp; Embrace my fatherless
child! farewell!&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">Macaire</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Bertrand</span> <i>turn to go off
and are met in the door by the</i> <span
class="smcap">Gendarmes</span>.)</p>
<h4>SCENE III</h4>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>To these</i>, <i>the</i> <span

<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span> (<i>aside</i>).&nbsp;
Bitten.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span> (<i>aside</i>).&nbsp; Sold
again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; Welcome, old
friend!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brigadier</span>.&nbsp; It is not the
friend that comes; it is the Brigadier.&nbsp; Summon your guests:
I must investigate their passports.&nbsp; I am in pursuit of a
notorious malefactor, Robert Macaire.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; But I was led to
believe that both Macaire and his accomplice had been arrested
and condemned.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brigadier</span>.&nbsp; They were, but
they have once more escaped for the moment, and justice is
indefatigable.&nbsp; (<i>He sits at table R.</i>)&nbsp; Dumont, a
bottle of white wine.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span> (<i>to</i> <span
class="smcap">Dumont</span>).&nbsp; My excellent friend, I will
discharge your commission, and return with all speed.&nbsp;
(<i>Going</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brigadier</span>.&nbsp; Halt!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span> (<i>returning: as if he
saw</i> <span class="smcap">Brigadier</span> <i>for the first
time</i>).&nbsp; Ha? a member of the force?&nbsp; Charmed,
I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; But you misconceive me: I return at once,
and my friend remains behind to answer for me.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brigadier</span>.&nbsp; Justice is
insensible to friendship.&nbsp; I shall deal with you in due
time.&nbsp; Dumont, that bottle.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Sir, my friend and
I, who are students of character, would grasp the opportunity to
share and&mdash;may one add?&mdash;to pay the bottle.&nbsp;
Dumont, three!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; For God&rsquo;s
sake!&nbsp; (<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Aline</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Maids</span>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; My friend is an
author: so, in a humbler way, am I.&nbsp; Your knowledge of the
criminal classes naturally tempts one to pursue so interesting an
acquaintance.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brigadier</span>.&nbsp; Justice is
impartial.&nbsp; Gentlemen, your health.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Will not these brave
fellows join us?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brigadier</span>.&nbsp; They are on duty;
but what matters?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; My dear sir, what is
duty? duty is my eye.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brigadier</span> (<i>solemnly</i>).&nbsp;
And Betty Martin.&nbsp; (<span class="smcap">Gendarmes</span>
<i>sit at table</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span> (<i>to</i> <span
class="smcap">Bertrand</span>).&nbsp; Dear friend, sit down.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span> (<i>sitting
down</i>).&nbsp; O Lord!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brigadier</span> (<i>to</i> <span
class="smcap">Macaire</span>).&nbsp; You seem to be a gentleman
of considerable intelligence.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; I fear, sir, you
flatter.&nbsp; One has lived, one has loved, and one remembers:
that is all.&nbsp; One&rsquo;s <i>Lives of Celebrated
Criminals</i> has met with a certain success, and one is ever in
quest of fresh material.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dumont</span>.&nbsp; By the way, a
singular thing about my patent key.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brigadier</span>.&nbsp; This gentleman is
speaking.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Excellent Dumont! he
means no harm.&nbsp; This Macaire is not personally known to
you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brigadier</span>.&nbsp; Are you connected
with justice?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Ah, sir, justice is
a point above a poor author.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brigadier</span> (<i>with
glass</i>).&nbsp; Justice is the very devil.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; My dear sir, my
friend and I, I regret to say, have an appointment in Lyons, or I
could spend my life in this society.&nbsp; Charge your glasses:
one hour to madness and to joy!&nbsp; What is to-morrow? the
enemy of to-day.&nbsp; Wine? the bath of life.&nbsp; One moment:
I find I have forgotten my watch.&nbsp; (<i>He makes for the
door</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brigadier</span>.&nbsp; Halt!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Sir, what is this
jest?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brigadier</span>.&nbsp; Sentry at the
door.&nbsp; Your passports.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; My good man, with
all the pleasure in life.&nbsp; (Gives papers.&nbsp; <i>The</i>

<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span> (<i>rising</i>, <i>and

soon find it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span> (<i>aside</i>).&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t I know?&nbsp; My heart&rsquo;s like fire in my
body.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brigadier</span>.&nbsp; Your name is?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; It is; one&rsquo;s
name is not unknown.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brigadier</span>.&nbsp; Justice exacts
your name.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp;
Henri-Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric de Latour de Main de la Tonnerre de
Brest.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brigadier</span>.&nbsp; Your
profession?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Gentleman.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brigadier</span>.&nbsp; No, but what is
your trade?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; I am an analytical
chymist.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brigadier</span>.&nbsp; Justice is
inscrutable.&nbsp; Your papers are in order.&nbsp; (<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.)&nbsp; Now, sir, and
yours?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; I feel kind of
ill.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Bertrand, this
gentleman addresses you.&nbsp; He is not one of us; in other
scenes, in the gay and giddy world of fashion, one is his
superior.&nbsp; But to-day he represents the majesty of law; and
as a citizen it is one&rsquo;s pride to do him honour.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brigadier</span>.&nbsp; Those are my
sentiments.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; I beg your pardon,
I&mdash;(<i>Gives papers</i>.)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brigadier</span>.&nbsp; Your name?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; Napoleon.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brigadier</span>.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; In
your passport it is written Bertrand.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s this
way: I was born Bertrand, and then I took the name of Napoleon,
and I mostly always call myself either Napoleon or Bertrand.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brigadier</span>.&nbsp; The truth is
always best.&nbsp; Your profession?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bertrand</span>.&nbsp; I am an orphan.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brigadier</span>.&nbsp; What the
devil!&nbsp; (<i>To</i> <span
class="smcap">Macaire</span>.)&nbsp; Is your friend an idiot?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Macaire</span>.&nbsp; Pardon me, he is a
poet.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brigadier</span>.&nbsp; Poetry is a great
hindrance to the ends of justice.&nbsp; Well, take your
papers.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
